        <title>The MarsBased CSS &amp; HTML Guidelines</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d406.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we started MarsBased, we&amp;#39;ve completed a good share of projects. From all of them we&amp;#39;ve learnt something useful. But all this knowledge should be stored somewhere for further use, for instance, to train new developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much like we did with the release of the MarsBased blogging guide (&lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/05/13/The-MarsBased-Blogging-Guide&quot; title=&quot;How to Create a Damn Good Blog Post&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/08/16/How-to-Create-a-Blogging-Strategy-for-your-Company&quot; title=&quot;How to Create a Blogging Strategy for Your Company&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;), we want to share what we have learnt about HTML5 &amp;amp; CSS3 with you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things should not only work well. They can also look good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers, this one is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Workflows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the technologies we use, we will introduce our working methodologies here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Task management&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.trello.com&quot; title=&quot;Trello&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; is our tool of choice for managing tasks and weekly sprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have one board for each project. Inside the project&amp;#39;s board, you&amp;#39;ll find columns for the present and coming weeks, along with &lt;i&gt;Done, Review Pending, Bugs, Features,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Backlog&lt;/i&gt;. In projects that have been already rolled out, you will see some columns for the deploys management, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Manager is in charge of assigning the layout &amp;amp; design tasks. You will see the cards assigned to you in the present week column. Once you have finished a task, you must add a new comment indicating the relevant pull request link, and move the card to the &lt;i&gt;Review&lt;/i&gt; Pending column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Manager will review the implementations and move the card to &lt;i&gt;Done&lt;/i&gt;, send it back to you (if there is something to fix) or forward it to the Development Team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekly sprints are defined on Mondays, in an online meeting between you and the Project Manager. However, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to get in touch with the Project Manager at any time, if you need to discuss anything or have any question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Commits &amp; Branches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with both &lt;a href=&quot;github.com&quot; title=&quot;Github&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;bitbucket.org&quot; title=&quot;Bitbucket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; and we always have separate repositories for the layout implementation and the development, so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about breaking stuff or learning Ruby on Rails. In other words, you will have to deal with HTML, CSS, and JS, only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we never work on the &lt;i&gt;master&lt;/i&gt; branch, as it only contains reviewed and finished stuff. Usually, we create a new branch for each task. However, we sometimes group small and related tasks to use only one branch for them. Apply common sense and branch wisely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Manager will merge those branches into &lt;i&gt;master&lt;/i&gt; after making the relevant reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when we make commits, we always include the type of change we have made between brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you&amp;#39;ve changed only the CSS code, you indicate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[CSS] Replaced the body background color.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have changed the HTML and you have replaced some images, you will write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[HTML+IMG] Replaced the default avatar.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to include other indications like &lt;i&gt;JS, README, CONFIG,&lt;/i&gt; etc. This way, our developers will be able to identify very quickly what they have to change in the development to replicate our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality is one of the founding values of MarsBased. A while back ago, we defined quality as &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;meeting and exceeding clients expectations while maintaining our own methodologies&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;. For that reason, exhaustive and successful testing is critical in our day to day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a front end developer, you’re in charge of testing how the applications look in all the required browsers and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our testing workflow is plain and simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In new projects where we start the development from scratch, we leave the testing tasks for the end and we do them all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In projects under maintenance (live products), we test each new feature or bug fix before sending the pull request to the development team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep this in mind all the time: an excellent developer is not just someone who creates good code, but is also a good tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tech Stack and Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Middleman&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;middlemanapp.com&quot; title=&quot;Middleman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; is a static websites generator built with Ruby on Rails. It integrates all the state-of-the-art frameworks and tools for frontend development (like SASS, Modernizr, Compass, Autoprefixer...) and allows you to use templating languages such as ERB or Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All our new projects are developed using Middleman, but before that, we used &lt;a href=&quot;jekyllrb.com&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is very similar to Middleman, with only a few differences between them. While we used Liquid as the templating language in Jekyll, now we switched to ERB in Middleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the project&amp;#39;s README file, you will find instructions about how to install the required packages and run any of those tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;MIDDLEMAN TOOLS&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleman lets you organize your code in layouts and partials. Do it wisely, we don&amp;#39;t want to have to deal with tons of files. Use partials only for stuff that will appear in several pages, or to split the code of very long pages, but always remember that &lt;i&gt;simpler is better&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have developed our own Middleman template called MarsMan. We use it as a model to create new projects. It contains all the folders, SASS mixins, frameworks and libraries that we use in our projects. Marsman is an open source project, so you can use it for your personal stuff or even send it to other people. You can download the code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarsBased/marsman-template&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased Github profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our Github profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use the Middleman helper &lt;i&gt;page_classes&lt;/i&gt; to define &lt;i&gt;page-specific&lt;/i&gt; classes in the body tag of the HTML. Use them carefully, we don&amp;#39;t want to create too many page dependencies in our CSS code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleman has a very useful set of helpers that let you add random Lorem Ipsum content and image placeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleman allows you to add Markdown content to a website by simply including a markdown file as a partial inside any other HTML file. We use Markdown files for text-only pages like Terms &amp;amp; Conditions, Privacy Policy or blog posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about Middleman and Jekyll in their official websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you never had the chance to use ERB, you can find some examples in &lt;a href=&quot;http://benfrain.com/understanding-middleman-the-static-site-generator-for-faster-prototyping/&quot; title=&quot;Middleman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our works are based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot; title=&quot;Bootstrap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a very well-known markup framework and it offers good compatibility with browsers and other components. Also, our developers are familiar with it and can reuse a lot of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to use always the last stable version of Bootstrap, in their SASS distribution. Since we also use SASS as our CSS framework of choice, you will be able to replace the Bootstrap variables and adapt them to each project. Do it whenever possible, instead of overwriting the Bootstrap properties. You can find the complete list of variables in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss&quot; title=&quot;Bootstrap SASS Github page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bootstrap SASS Github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Bootstrap has a very powerful grid system. It can be used by simply including classes in the HTML markup, such as &lt;i&gt;.row&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;.col-xs-6&lt;/i&gt;. However, instead of using those classes to define rows and columns, we prefer to use the Bootstrap mixins. They also allow you to define rows and columns, but you can do it directly in the SASS files, without dirtying the HTML code. Following this approach, we can completely separate the markup of a website from its styles and we make the application easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, instead of doing:
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;container&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;results row&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;item col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      The Martian
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We prefer to do:
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;container&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;results&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      The Martian
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:
&lt;pre&gt;
.results
  +make-row()
.item
  +make-xs-column(12)
  +make-sm-column(6)
  +make-md-column(4)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/mixins/_grid.scss&quot; title=&quot;Mixins used in the grid system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mixins used in the grid system&lt;/a&gt; also in Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;SASS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SASS is a CSS preprocessor that lets you use variables, functions, operations, and other useful stuff inside your CSS stylesheets. You can learn how to use SASS in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot; title=&quot;SASS official website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re sure you&amp;#39;ll find it very easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;PARTIALS&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organize our SASS code in partials that we later import in a single file called &lt;i&gt;application.sass&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partials are organized in folders. Take a look at this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
/stylesheets

  /utils
    _mixins.sass
    _variables.sass
    _helpers.sass
    _keyframes.sass

  /modules
    _navbar.sass
    _footer.sass
    _items.sass
    _filters.sass

  /layouts
    _home.sass
    _results.sass

  application.sass

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;/utils&lt;/i&gt; folder is where we store our helpers, mixins and keyframes - coding tools that we use in our HTML and SASS files. We also have a file called &lt;i&gt;_variables.sass&lt;/i&gt; that contains generic variables like color or typography definitions. However, page- or module-specific variables are not stored here but inside the corresponding layout or module file (you can find an example a couple of paragraphs from here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;/modules&lt;/i&gt; folder contains the styles of the differents components that compose each page. And finally, we use the &lt;i&gt;/layouts&lt;/i&gt; folder to include styles we need to apply to specific pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the difference between layouts and modules is still not clear for you, have a look at the following example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say that we have to develop a marketplace with a results page, where each result is an item. Some of these items will also appear in the Home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would create a &lt;i&gt;_items.sass&lt;/i&gt; file inside &lt;i&gt;/modules&lt;/i&gt; and we would put there all the styles that apply to the items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
// modules/_item.sass

.item

  $item-primary-color: #000000 // Variable specific to this module!

  padding: 20px
  background-color: #f4f4f4

  .title
    color: $item-primary-color
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider that these items have to look differently in the Homepage than in the Results view. In that case, we would create a &lt;i&gt;_home.sass&lt;/i&gt; file inside &lt;i&gt;/layouts&lt;/i&gt; with the following styles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
// modules/_home.sass

.home
  .item
    background-color: inherit
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;NAMING CONVENTIONS&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to name our elements and classes, we follow the modular approach explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesassway.com/advanced/modular-css-naming-conventions&quot; title=&quot;Modular CSS naming conventions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesassway.com/&quot; title=&quot;The SASS Way&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The SASS Way&lt;/a&gt;. However, we don&amp;#39;t apply the &lt;i&gt;parent-child&lt;/i&gt; rules, as we prefer to use nesting for such cases. In any case, if you ever have to define parent-child relations, use a dash (-) as a separator instead of an underscore (_) or any other symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to differentiate keyframes (animations) from classes or IDs, we name them without dashes or underscores:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
// Keyframes

@keyframes fadeIn
  0%
    opacity: 0
  100%
    opacity: 1

@keyframes fadeOut
  0%
    opacity: 1
  100%
    opacity: 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;OTHER GUIDELINES&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create your own mixins, but do it only when they will save you a lot of time, without adding too much complexity to the project. We don&amp;#39;t want to increase the application complexity because other less experienced coders might have to work on it at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nesting is one of the most powerful tools of SASS. However, it can be counterproductive if not used wisely. We follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule&quot; title=&quot;The Inception Rule&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inception Rule&lt;/a&gt; defined in The SASS Way. It says that you can&amp;#39;t go more than four levels deep. It also explains how to organize the different selectors and properties in site-wide rules, page specific rules and objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In projects where we don&amp;#39;t have to support IE8 or lower, we use REM units to define font sizes, margins, heights, widths, etc. REM units work in a similar way than EMs, but they are proportional to the HTML tag &lt;i&gt;font-size&lt;/i&gt;. Bootstrap defines the HTML &lt;i&gt;font-size&lt;/i&gt; to 10px, so using REM units is very easy: 1rem will always be equal to 10px, 1.4rem will be equal to 14px, 0.8rem will be equal to 8px, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Autoprefixer, Modernizr, and Compass&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/middleman/middleman-autoprefixer&quot; title=&quot;Autoprefixer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Autoprefixer&lt;/a&gt; is a plugin that parses the CSS files and adds browser specific prefixes to the properties that require them. This means that you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about adding prefixes such as -webkit-, -moz- or -ms- because Autoprefixer does it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://modernizr.com/&quot; title=&quot;Modernizr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Modernizr&lt;/a&gt; is a JavaScript library that detects if the user&amp;#39;s browser supports HTML5 and CSS3 features or not. You can use it to build fallbacks for modern features that old browsers might not support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://compass-style.org/&quot; title=&quot;Compass&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt; is another CSS framework included in our Middleman projects. We prefer to use Autoprefixer to add browser specific prefixes, but you might want to use Compass for other things, like its vast library of reliable mixins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Images and icons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;VECTORIAL IMAGES&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For logos, icons and small images we prefer to use SVG files instead of PNGs or JPGs because SVGs are made from vectors and can be resized without losing quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To include SVG files in the HTML code, drop the SVG files in the &lt;i&gt;shapes&lt;/i&gt; directory. All SVG files are formatted in XML. Make sure that they don&amp;#39;t have more data than the necessary (some apps like Adobe Illustrator include irrelevant information inside the SVG files that can produce errors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, you will have to execute a job that will take all the SVG files from the &lt;i&gt;shapes&lt;/i&gt; directory and produce a file called &lt;i&gt;shapes.html&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;grunt svg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file should be included in all the app&amp;#39;s pages as a partial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; &amp;lt;body class=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;%= page_classes %&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;%= partial &amp;quot;partials/shapes&amp;quot; %&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;%= yield %&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;%= javascript_include_tag  :application %&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can include any SVG image in your HTML by simply calling it. Use this markup to do it so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;svg class=&amp;quot;shape shape-filename&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;use xlink:href=&amp;quot;#shape-filename&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/use&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;BOOTSTRAP GLYPHICONS AND FONT AWESOME&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the design doesn&amp;#39;t come with its own icons, we like to use the ones provided by Bootstrap and Font Awesome. If you don&amp;#39;t find any suitable icon, try looking in websites like &lt;a href=&quot;iconfinder.com&quot; title=&quot;Iconfinder.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iconfinder.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;IMAGE HELPERS&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, we will have to deal with normal images like PNGs or JPGs. In that case, we use the image-url helper in the CSS files to point to files stored in the images folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;.navbar
  background: image-url(&amp;#39;navbar-background.png&amp;#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the HTML markup, however, we use another helper called &lt;i&gt;image_tag&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%= image_tag &amp;#39;padrino.png&amp;#39;, width: &amp;#39;35&amp;#39;, class: &amp;#39;logo pull-right&amp;#39; %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more examples of the &lt;i&gt;image_tag&lt;/i&gt; helper in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html#method-i-image_tag&quot; title=&quot;Ruby on Rails API documentation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails API documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;JS libraries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all the JS libraries work well with Rails and AngularJS. For that reason, and also because we like to standardize the code of our projects, we have created a list of preferred libraries. If you ever have to use another library, consult our Development Team first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modals:&lt;/b&gt; ng-dialog (only in AngularJS projects) and Bootstrap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dropdown menus:&lt;/b&gt; Bootstrap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selects:&lt;/b&gt; Select2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tabs:&lt;/b&gt; Bootstrap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carousels:&lt;/b&gt; Slick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checkbox and radio buttons:&lt;/b&gt; Pure CSS (label after the input technique).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charts:&lt;/b&gt; C3 &amp;amp; D3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Autocomplete:&lt;/b&gt; Select2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Range sliders:&lt;/b&gt; bootstrap-slider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scroll:&lt;/b&gt; Just the browser scrollbar (avoid using JS scrollbars like Perfect Scrollbar if possible).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affix &amp;amp; Scrollspy:&lt;/b&gt; Bootstrap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tooltips &amp;amp; popovers:&lt;/b&gt; Bootstrap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alerts:&lt;/b&gt; Bootstrap + simple fade in with JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Text editors:&lt;/b&gt; TinyMCE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Date management:&lt;/b&gt; MomentJS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Datepickers:&lt;/b&gt; Pickadate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Animations:&lt;/b&gt; Pure CSS. Velocity if more complex animations are needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progress Bars:&lt;/b&gt; Pure CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maps:&lt;/b&gt; Leaflet or Google Maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parallax:&lt;/b&gt; Pure CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Image galleries:&lt;/b&gt; Slick.js inside a modal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chat mentions:&lt;/b&gt; AT.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Code spacing and formatting guidelines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;80 CHARACTERS PER LINE&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not always possible, but in order to improve code legibility we try to make lines no longer than 80 characters (this applies to HTML, JS, and SASS too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to split an HTML tag, do it between attributes and indent the second line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a class=&amp;quot;item-link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://www.marsbased.com&amp;quot;
  target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  MarsBased Website
&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced text editors like Sublime Text allow you to add a ruler on your screen that mark where the 80 characters per line are reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;HTML FILES&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t include any extra line-breaks between &lt;i&gt;divs&lt;/i&gt; and other elements. Also, we avoid using HTML comments unless they are completely necessary to explain how something is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;results&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;MarsBased website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- .item --&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- .results --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prefer to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;results&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;MarsBased website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus:&lt;/b&gt; there is a Sublime Text plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces&quot; title=&quot;TrailingSpaces&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TrailingSpaces&lt;/a&gt; that detects unnecessary blank spaces in your code and deletes them all at once with a keyboard shortcut!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;SASS FILES&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a CSS selector doesn’t have any property inside it, we leave no space between the selector and the selector that comes next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;.results
  .item
    border: 1px solid purple
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if a selector has some properties, we add an extra line break between the last property and the next selector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;.results
padding: 10px 20px

.item
border: 1px solid purple
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;SEO&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow the SEO best practices of naming all the elements with HTML5 semantic tags, when possible, like &lt;i&gt;header, aside, section, nav, footer, article,&lt;/i&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside each of these tags, we try to respect a hierarchic structure of headings. It sounds obvious, but &lt;i&gt;h1&lt;/i&gt; elements must contain &lt;i&gt;h2&lt;/i&gt; and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we always add the &lt;i&gt;title&lt;/i&gt; attribute to all the links and &lt;i&gt;title&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt; to all the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document&quot; title=&quot;HTML5 elements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; for a complete guide of HTML5 elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;LINKS BETWEEN PAGES&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our layouts are used by our programmers to understand how they have to develop an application. However, our clients use them too to review the status of a project and to show the user interface to other people like investors or partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, we create navigational layouts linking all the pages and our projects can be used as a normal application (although the content is completely static). For example, if someone clicks the “Sign up” link of the navigation bar, we take him to the Sign Up page, where he will be able to check how it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a long read, indeed! Have you learnt something useful? Do you want to add something? Let us know in the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Presenting the Barcelona Startups Community on Slack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d386.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is the new trend in online communications. Given its free-for-all policy, all kinds of companies adopted this popular communication app as their &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; communication platform. Slack is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/3042326/tech-forecast/with-500000-users-slack-says-its-the-fastest-growing-business-app-ever&quot; title=&quot;Fast Company article about Slack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quickly becoming a communication standard&lt;/a&gt; among companies and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re excited to announce the launch of a Slack Community for &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; Barcelona startups and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcnstartup.typeform.com/to/YV0pu1&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Startup Slack Community&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to join the Barcelona Startup community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the success Slack found in companies, communities are now embracing Slack as a tool to engage with their current members and attract new ones. Communities such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nomadlist.com/&quot; title=&quot;Nomad List&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nomad List&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.link/&quot; title=&quot;Ruby on Rails community&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; are some of the best examples of online Slack communities. There are some great individuals compiling lists of Slack communities, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@angiecois/an-incomplete-list-of-communities-on-slack-1b1b6f157bda&quot; title=&quot;An incomplete list of communities on Slack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one created by Angela Cois&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why Slack?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffer wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bufferapp.com/slack-community&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&#39;s guide to Slack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a very useful guide about how to create a Slack community&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the advantages of bringing everyone together. This way, purely offline communities can now become online, while other online-based communities, can use Slack to offer a new level of interaction among their members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, Slack&amp;#39;s market share is the main reason why we chose it as our app of choice, thus minimising the cost of adopting a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack also supports multi-team sign-in. So if you are using Slack with your team, you can quickly switch to another one with a keyboard shortcut. In the following picture you can see my Slack (notice the left bar, where each icon is a Slack team):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post25a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slack&#39;s multi-team support&quot; title=&quot;Slack&#39;s multi-team support&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;I&amp;#39;m on 9 teams! Nine interesting teams just a keyboard shortcut away!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Slack has got really cool mobile apps. You can chat from your phone or tablet, from wherever you are, irrespective of the device you&amp;#39;re using. This is a fundamental feature for a distributed team like MarsBased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack also offers a huge flexibility on how to use it. Pinned documents, search, mentions, file sharing, integrations with dozens of interesting services and other killer features make Slack a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our community can grow to have hundreds (or even thousands!) of members without having to worry about the scalability of this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How will we use it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main goal is to become the largest Slack community in Barcelona for entrepreneurs &amp;amp; startups. We will connect entrepreneurs that want to help each other and share relevant content &lt;strong&gt;in real time&lt;/strong&gt; with the different communities in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start rolling out to the Startup Grind members today and like-minded companies &amp;amp; individuals. We want to open it up to the whole Barcelona startup community shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Slack, we are able to bring the communication between community members to another level. For instance, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; we offer the first hour of the event to our attendees, and we call it the &lt;i&gt;Community Hour&lt;/i&gt;. In our Open Mic session, between 15 and 20 entrepreneurs per event come on stage to ask help for their projects and offer their services in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our attendees have asked/offered very different things during the Open Mic: a cofounder, a CTO, investment, some growth hacking ideas, mentoring and even translators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post25b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Open Mic at Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Open Mic at Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Our friend Michael from Miniguide.es rocking the stage during our Open Mic!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we created a channel to move this interesting exchange online, so you don&amp;#39;t have to wait for the next event! You will never miss that interesting person who spoke at the Open Mic, but you didn&amp;#39;t get to talk to. You can find them in our Slack community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: our attendees can also send questions in real time to the speaker during the fireside chat, or live-comment the interview and/or the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we will grow the number of users, we will listen to what they want, and adapt the Slack community to them. If they want a channel to offer jobs, or to bring in a new community, or engage with influencers, or any other need, we will try to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How can you use it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to benefit with this online Startup community. We&amp;#39;re bringing immediate solutions to startups and freelancers alike, who way too often require immediate ideas or resources to complete the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re a couple of clicks away of asking for help in the general channel, comment an event on its corresponding channel, send a private message to that designer freelancer to hire him or just to chat a lazy Sunday away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also use this Slack community to promote your cool stuff. Oftentimes, too many projects go unnoticed, so a good way to give your stuff more visibility is by being among the early adopters of a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share your blog posts, your startup&amp;#39;s job openings, your events or your latest logo design through this platform. There are endless possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Community Giveback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased, we feel very attached to the Barcelona entrepreneurial community. Not only did we run for almost two years the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/09/21/Five-Reasons-Why-Your-Company-Should-Organise-an-Event/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Circle, by MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Circle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarsBased/status/391521920858214400&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased Tweet about Startup Circle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&amp;#39;s our tweet announcing it back then!&lt;/a&gt;) but we&amp;#39;re also behind Startup Grind Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Startup Circle, we brought together a community of 50 individuals &amp;amp; companies that met once or twice a month to help one another and socialise. That was our door to entrepreneurship, and we hope it has helped other people as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since March 2014, we&amp;#39;re also running Startup Grind in Barcelona, with the help of some brilliant people such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupgrind.cat/contact/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carlos Cruz, Alex Gonzalez and a team of volunteers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this Slack community, we want to give back to the community that helped us grow when we started. This is especially important for global companies like ours that want to help foster business opportunities in their area. At MarsBased, we like to contribute back to the Barcelona startup scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

        <title>Code Refactoring: When, Why and Who</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d365.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of tech companies has caused a higher adoption of technology among new generations. People are learning how to code in order to keep up with the times, or to reinvent themselves professionally to unlock new paths in their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we code, the more we need to make it a sustainable practice. Quantity almost never implies quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter code refactoring. Everyone talks about &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; refactoring is, and &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to do it, but we want to talk about the other three dimensions: when to do it, why, and who should do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a target=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring&quot; title=&quot;Code refactoring&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code – changing the factoring – without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are the CTO of a recently-founded dev shop: sitting in front of your laptop, fingers ready to code, while waiting for your salesman to bring in the contract for the next Facebook. However, the first project happens to come with legacy. That is, a client hires your company to fix an already existing project, which unsurprisingly is broken. The first five words that come to mind are: &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;I can do this better!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, at MarsBased, a very large proportion of our existing clients had a different provider in the past, but they decided to change for different reasons. This is something we learnt during &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marsbased.com/blog/2015/04/13/Lessons-Learned-One-Year-Running-Our-Own-Business/&quot;&gt;our first year operating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you being able to rewrite better code may actually be true, you should also consider the client&amp;#39;s needs. Why did this project end up on your table? Maybe the quality of the deliverables was insufficient, or maybe because the client perceived the development team&amp;#39;s pace was very low and he was running out of patience (and cash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having that in mind, it will probably take longer to start from scratch, and rebuild everything instead of replacing the existing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we decide? We do it case by case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coding by the fireplace&quot; title=&quot;Coding by the fireplace&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;In this entry, we&amp;#39;re talking about code refactoring: when, why and who. If we were to talk about the where, it would probably be here.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The When&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the application is too big, a whole refactor can take ages. It will also be impossible to rebuild it while maintaining the strict deadlines the market or the investors dictate. On the other hand, if the application is small enough, you might also get distracted by too much refactoring instead of adding new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our customers hire us to give answers. If the code we find in legacy projects is not good, we tell them. We can also audit the code and provide a report with the cost of rebuilding everything or opting for a complete refactor. Most of the times, though, the clients want to keep up with the ongoing development while adopting a progressive refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, &lt;i&gt;progressive refactoring&lt;/i&gt; is sticking to the development roadmap and its new features, while improving the existing code with each release. When we need to touch legacy code, our commitment is to &lt;i&gt;leave it better than before&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By applying this, you will find that the application progressively looks and feels way better, without affecting the releases roadmap and the product evolution. This is extremely important in projects that have already launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s more than that. The fight for the &lt;i&gt;Greater Code&lt;/i&gt; is better fought with tests. The quality of tests (or lack thereof) in legacy projects is a game-changer. Refactoring the tests is as important as refactoring the code. But again, you will have to agree with the client the deadlines &amp;amp; deliverables, and the time devoted to refactoring and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refactoring is a time investment: you devote time now to make it easier to work on it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Why&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having explained when we should refactor, now it is the time to say the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;New is always better&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; may sound great, but old code can save you time. While it may be outdated, or even not work, it is the result of somebody else&amp;#39;s effort to solve a specific problem, and their approach could be really different from yours. So you can still learn a lot from other people&amp;#39;s code before throwing it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our approach is to leave code better than we found it, we always try to understand the existing code in order to improve it. It might even contain a solution you would have never come across!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, bad code tends to replicate itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be honest: we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; copy and paste code. Although we ought not to do it, we borrow code often to either save time or solve complexities beyond our skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we should replace bad code when we find it. By eliminating bad code, we eliminate the chance of somebody borrowing those parts for other projects. This is even more so important when introducing new hires or less-experienced programmers to the project: they might think that code is yours or, worse, perceive it as a reference and replicate it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our CTO, Xavi, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marsbased.com/blog/2014/08/22/The-Martians-conquer-the-IronHack/&quot;&gt; gave a talk at Ironhack a year ago&lt;/a&gt; where he talked about the maintainability of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, we need to refactor code to improve code quality, maintainability and legibility, while making it easier for other teammates to become familiar with the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Who&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe refactoring is good for everybody, but &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; should do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refactoring forces you to think over a piece of code that somebody else wrote trying to solve a difficulty. It might as well be code you wrote in another company or even years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased, all of us refactor code from the very first day. We&amp;#39;re given the style guide and instructed to produce quality code right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When introducing a new team member to a project, it is a good practice to make him refactor the code. This way, he does not only become familiar with the project, but we&amp;#39;re weaseling in some good practices we seldom might find time for. By touching code here and there, we&amp;#39;re forced to swim through the different layers &amp;amp; components until we get the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior developers have more room to learn, and sharing your refactoring tools with them will make them grow as developers in the right direction. They are also less prone to have any bad habits acquired throughout the years, and tend to write code the way they read it. They may also need a senior developer to guide them through the process in the beginning, but soon enough they develop the habit of writing healthy code. Once again, time invested in mentoring a junior developer will pay off threefold in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time goes by, the initiated developers will feel more confident in their coding skills, and they will start suggesting changes and improvements on other people&amp;#39;s code. A self-confident developer will be far more independent taking decisions that will benefit the project. All thanks to a good learning process through guidance and demanding quality from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only have we got a commitment towards the clients to deliver quality code, but with the established deadlines and the product roadmap. These are a couple of ways how we align with our clients&amp;#39; business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your experience on refactoring from day zero? Have you ever tried it? Would you add other Whys Whens or Whos? If you have any thoughts on the subject feel free to share them using the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Reasons Why Your Company Should Organise an Event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d352.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After over a year and a half organising the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2013/11/07/startup-circle-barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Circle in Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Circle in Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to pull the plug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been hosting Startup Circle and &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt; until we realised they shared the same dynamics and principles: educating, inspiring and connecting entrepreneurs by helping each other. Therefore, we decided to merge the two communities to take Startup Grind BCN to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all these months, we have learnt the following benefits of organising events as a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. It broadens your networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By organising an event, you will have to contact different sorts of companies than those on your sales funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your event might require sponsors to help you with the expenses, or companies willing to pay for the catering or beverages in exchange for exposure and presence in the event. This is your entry point to a whole new set of potential clients or partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on what kind of event you&amp;#39;re planning, you might also need good speakers or celebrities to attract bigger audiences. By inviting them to an event, you have an excuse to shoot an email to that big guy and start a conversation. This might eventually bring some unexpected business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you bring value to all the new contacts you make, and all else will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post23a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thanking sponsors at Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Thanking sponsors at Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;At Startup Grind Barcelona first anniversary, we had our sponsors&amp;#39; logos in front of 180 people. Who doesn&amp;#39;t want that?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. It gives you media exposure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though there are lots of events going on, events are like startups: most of them fail. Therefore, we recommend waiting before you pitch the press too early. Instead, try building a solid event before marketing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in the press, bloggers, social media influencers and media-friendly individuals are usually busy people who get lots of invitations to check out the latest cool event in town. Try making their life easier by waiting until your event is really valuable to invite them over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will appreciate your patience, and your event will be good enough for them to like it and write about it. Some of them will come back in the next edition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting with the first point, this will also open doors in the press and media community. Use them wisely, as some of them are one-off shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. You will be recognised as an expert&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company or individual in business has a target customer. We are used to bombing our target customers by sending them our services brochures, newsletters or project quotes. We are usually too &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; in our sales process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people can think differently about this and give real value to the customer before thinking about money. We have seen companies or freelancers offering free e-books or webinars to attract new clients. This is giving before taking, which is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cio.com/article/2867406/marketing/how-to-use-ebooks-to-improve-your-content-marketing-strategy.html&quot; title=&quot;Ebooks increase sales&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; proven way to increase your sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try to cater your potential customers with an event for them. Listen to their necessities and build the event around them. What do they want? Workshops? Inspirational stories? Quality networking? An informal meeting to drink beer with like-minded people? Something they can sponsor to get exposure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, you might not be the expert in the room, but you&amp;#39;re the one making things happen. You are organising an event regularly, thus creating value in the community. This will help people think of you when looking for an expert in your field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if you can bring together dozens - or hundreds - of people in the same room regularly, with some experts here and there, that means you know &lt;em&gt;a thing or two&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Offline is the new online&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, not having online presence was business suicide. When Internet became more accessible worldwide, all companies transitioned to the web and the first movers had a head start on the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we think that being &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; can really boost your success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology made it easier for everybody to put up a sharp-looking landing page, using services like About.me, Strikingly or Squarespace, credibility is now at stake. If everybody can afford that, how can we be sure that the people behind those websites are legitimate/a big company/a full time consultant/a quality provider? The answer is clear: by meeting them in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might look contradictory that a remote working company is telling you to do business in person, but that&amp;#39;s human nature. Physical presence breeds trust, as stated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://realbusiness.co.uk/article/26202-building-trust-is-all-important-when-doing-business-online&quot; title=&quot;Interview to Tobias Kormind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tobias Kormind, manager of 77 Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. Build up trust in real life, then move to the online world once the business happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. People will help you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could not wrap up this blog entry without underlining how great it is to meet new people, and here&amp;#39;s our way to thank them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post23b.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Enjoying a cold one after work with Startup Circle&quot; title=&quot;Enjoying a cold one after work with Startup Circle&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;With our friends from Dineyo, Nektria, Rockyourmeal and the rest of Startup Circle in one of our after-work events.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your event is genuine enough, people will sympathise with it. Some of them will tweet about it, share it on their social profiles, while some others will help you with a connection or two. You can even get people volunteer for you if they see the real value in the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your event should be your way of giving back to the community that saw you start up your business. It is not only an act of kindness, but your community will genuinely benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our experience and, of course, we will like to complement it with your insight. Do you also organise events? Are you an expert on the matter? Feel free to share what you have learnt so far in the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Create a Blogging Strategy for Your Company</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d317.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been blogging for some time now, and we’ve learnt a thing or two. Because we’ve adopted transparency as an integral part of the company culture, we like sharing what we learn with you. It’s a genuine way to give back to the community that has helped so much become what we are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this entry, we will cover how to create a blogging strategy for your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re really proud of how and what we blog, because it helps us keeping track of our evolution as a global development shop, and feel like this could prove useful to many others that come after us. Exactly the same way we learnt from others like &lt;a href=&quot;www.buffer.com&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;dockyard.com&quot; title=&quot;Dockyard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dockyard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;thoughtbot.com&quot; title=&quot;Thoughtbot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thoughtbot&lt;/a&gt; or other blogs we follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/05/13/The-MarsBased-Blogging-Guide/&quot; title=&quot;The MarsBased Blogging Guide pt.1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first part of our blogging guide&lt;/a&gt;. In the first part, we described how to craft a good blog post, by choosing a good title, the appropriate keywords, a fitting image, and other important criteria bloggers follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is nowadays a very important element in growing your company: it is one of the cheapest methods to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbound_marketing&quot; title=&quot;Definition of Inbound Marketing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inbound marketing&lt;/a&gt;, provides SEO, and helps you demonstrate your expertise to a very large audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this second part, we’re going to describe how to choose a blogging strategy for your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Choose a goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, one must identify what is the purpose of his/her blog. A blog can be a good tool to publish news about your company, how-to guides, inspirational stories, funny viral content or almost whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common uses is content marketing. In this case, companies blog about the topics they want to be identified with and thus, they create new content for their site on a frequent basis. This content, in turn, attracts potential customers to their sales funnel. Google and most search engines like original content that updates regularly, hence being blogs a most useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased we use it to drive qualified traffic to our website, so we made it a key element in our sales toolset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we created the company, we didn’t have that much of a strategy, so we wrote posts about our company evolution: what we did and why we did it. However, some of these posts helped us rank high enough in search engines because they contained the right keywords. For instance, our most visited blog entry is &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/03/25/we-make-the-right-app2/&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased tech stack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one we wrote about our tech stack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have received a couple of project requests because of our post about technologies. In that post, we didn’t only show our expertise on the listed tools, but the content also made us rank higher on Google, especially in high-demanded technologies like AngularJS or Sidekiq because they’re specific enough to be very visible to the few people that google them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings us onto the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question:&lt;/strong&gt; what do you want your blog to be known for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Identify your target and blog for it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve selected the purpose of your blog, you need to choose the audience. Who will read your blog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, chances are you will want the whole world to read your blog from the get-go. However, it is a nearly impossible task to bring a generic blog to big audiences by making it grow organically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your target audience is the whole world, you are probably doing something wrong. You’d better hire somebody skilled in growth-hacking, or use paid marketing strategies (SEM) to achieve rapid growth. But we will not be covering this scenario in our guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safer way is to choose a very defined audience and go for it. For instance, if your product is a fitness app, you should blog about fitness, nutrition and healthy lifestyles to attract your target audience: nutritionists, people that want to get fit, gym rats, personal trainers, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we want to build trust with companies we haven’t met yet and attract potential clients, by proving our expertise in web development. Therefore, we are sharing how we work, what we do, and things that are interesting to C-level personnel, our entry point in most companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining a target audience will also help you choose the kind of content and the language level. You can blog about marketing for the CMOs, tech stuff for CTOs and productivity for CEOs. Having multiple targets or multiple topics is not less effective, so long as it is part of your business strategy and you cater all of them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the language, technical posts might have technicisms, but it does not hurt to explain the acronyms or lead the reader somewhere where he/she can find the definitions (e.g: &amp;quot;If you don’t know what Inbound Marketing is, read this post over here…”). The more specific your target audience is, the more niche keywords you are allowed to use. Elsewise, if you’re targeting a massive audience, you will have to use very high-level and generic language, avoiding all sorts of acronyms, technical words or jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question&lt;/strong&gt;: What readers do you want to engage with through your blog and what do you need of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Define your topics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have chosen your goal and your audience, you must identify what will be interesting to your target readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best blogs often cover just one specific topic. It might be travel, entrepreneurship, productivity, cuisine or knitting. But some blogs cover many topics to attract different sorts of target readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re bootstrapping a company, you will most likely neither have the time to blog, nor the resources to have somebody do that for you. A good tip is to start small by covering a single topic. For instance, our buddies at &lt;a href=&quot;https://getquipu.com/en&quot; title=&quot;Quipu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quipu&lt;/a&gt;, a personal finances app (built using Ruby on Rails!), chose to target small companies and freelancers/contractors that want to automate their bookkeeping. As a result of that, they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://getquipu.com/blog/&quot; title=&quot;Quipu Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blogging about personal finances&lt;/a&gt;: how to do paperwork, how-to guides on taxes &amp;amp; forms, common mistakes in bookkeeping and tips about saving money on taxes are some of the topics they’ve dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might look obvious, but if you write about startups and entrepreneurship, don&amp;#39;t review your most favourite restaurants. It&amp;#39;s OK to go offtopic every once in a while, but not every second post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is that choosing the right topics attracts like-minded people, it’ll rank great in Google and you can share it in niche groups or publications to be exposed to a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question:&lt;/strong&gt; What field(s) is your company most proficient in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Measure your tempo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a common mistake to start writing a blog with nothing to publish. Most people build up a few posts before launching the blog so that they can publish stacked posts for the first weeks, without having to worry about running out of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you’re really committed to writing frequently, chances are, in your first blog you’ll write very effusively for some time and then will stop after a few weeks. That is why you should include the posting frequency in your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is better to define a frequency and follow it strictly. For instance, at MarsBased we decided to post once a month a while back ago, and since earlier this year we’ve achieved it. Now we plan to blog twice a month to include a technical post, and a non-technical post to cater our different targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good advice is to define a minimum, never a fixed number. It is better to say “I will post at least once every fortnight” than “I will publish 3 posts a month”. This way, if you&amp;#39;re really prolific one month, you can go over your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you grow your company, you will also want to grow your content team. Likewise, depending on how important is the blog to your goals, you will increase the number of posts per month/week/day at a sustainable pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few variations of the sentence “Content is king”. We’d like to add our bit to it: “Content is king, constancy is queen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question:&lt;/strong&gt; How often can you afford making your blog your first priority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pick a date &amp;amp; time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have defined your blog frequency, you need to select what days &amp;amp; times are better for your readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you should take into account your timezone. Say, if you’re an offshoring development company from India and your target is the UK, try posting in their morning, so that people read your blog first thing during breakfast or during their commute to work. Also, companies targeting US clients should choose between East &amp;amp; West Coast. A good tactic is to publish for East Coast first, and then publish the link in the social networks for each different time zone you might have defined as target (West Coast, Japan, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;buffer.com&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; and other social media gurus, the best time to blog is either early in the morning or right after lunch. There does not seem to be a consensus on which days of the week are better for blogging. Test it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test, measure, repeat. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/analytics/&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;medium.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Medium&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; and many Wordpress plugins are really effective when measuring the impact of your blog posts. By using them, you can understand your audience and adjust your publishing times to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question:&lt;/strong&gt; When are your target readers most prone to devote some time to read you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Produce content worth sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t really know a lot about how to monetise a blog, so this tip goes to bloggers that want to get exposure organically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our favourite social media gurus, Guy Kawasaki, explained what is the most effective tactic to be noticed on social networks. His advice is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-london-hosted-guy-kawasaki-canvaex-apple#/&quot; title=&quot;Guy Kawasaki at Startup Grind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create content worth sharing&lt;/a&gt;. Your content can be inspiring, educational, fun, viral, give free content or what have you, but it should really get your audience to spread the word for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is your friend and can really boost your number of views and shares: aim for retweets or shareable content. Not only will the entry be good, but you can also test stuff outside of the content. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-writing-great-headlines-on-twitter-facebook-and-your-blog&quot; title=&quot;Buffer Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buffer test their blog posts titles using the social networks&lt;/a&gt;. They share each blog entry with three or four different titles and perform A/B testing. The tweet that gets more visits, retweets, likes and favourites is the best title for the blog. This is only a way to A/B test it, but there are millions of ideas out there! Be creative!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social networks also offer a great chance to engage with your community. For those old enough to have used internet forums back when they were the thing - in the pre-Google or pre-Myspace days - we saw people posting stuff in forums to get like-minded people’s opinion and interesting discussions. You can do the same here, by wrapping up the post with a call to action, as we said in the first part of our blogging guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also learn a lot from Instagram, where famous Instagrammers ask to “tag a friend” when that photo relates to them in any way. Hence, we can ask our friends or colleagues to comment on a post we wrote if we think it applies to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question:&lt;/strong&gt; if you read this blog entry somewhere else, would you share it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Content must be educational and inspiring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that works very well for me, when I am looking for new ideas, is to read a lot of blogs. From there, I always spot one or two blog entries that catch my attention and I want to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, CartoDB’s entry of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@saleiva/how-we-hire-3e696c3aee59&quot; title=&quot;CartoDB Medium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“How we hire”&lt;/a&gt; inspired Pablo Villalba’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://micho.biz/post/117083319566/how-we-hire&quot; title=&quot;Pablo Villalba Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“How we hire”&lt;/a&gt; and, in turn, inspired me to include it in our Article Ideas board on Trello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post22a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our blog ideas on Trello&quot; title=&quot;Our blog ideas on Trello&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got a Trello board for our blog posts.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These posts were inspirational: not only do they make me want to write something similar for MarsBased, but they might also inspire us to adopt some new tools, strategies or techniques in our daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, the content needs to be also useful and teach you something new. It must educate. This is especially so for companies like ours that want to prove their technical skills before they get hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good examples of educational blog posts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-case-study-in-multiple-time-zones&quot; title=&quot;Thoughtbot blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/07/31/taking-advantage-of-time-limitations-in-design&quot; title=&quot;Dockyard blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chopdawg.com/managing-company-remotely/&quot; title=&quot;Chopdawg blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re pretty sure they have helped those companies to earn a few more leads by demonstrating their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your favourite blogs and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make it visible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tremendous mistake bloggers make is not letting the world know they have a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on, you’ve spent time setting up a blog, creating a brand for it - if not company -, researching, writing content, picking nice images, tweaking its look &amp;amp; feel, selecting the keywords and all these chores, yet you don’t tell every soul about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things you can do:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update all your social media profiles to link to your blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add it to your LinkedIn profile in the “URLs” section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join blog listings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post your content in LinkedIn/Google+/Facebook groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate your social network accounts to publish automatically every new entry using tools like IFTTT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask famous people on Twitter to retweet you (do it only if the content relates to them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add it to your signature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key question:&lt;/strong&gt; Where do you want your blog to get noticed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations if you have made it this far. Now it&amp;#39;s time to define your strategy and blog your way to success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know if we have missed something in our comments section!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Working Remotely from Berlin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d263.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our previous blog entry (&lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/06/15/Six-Tips-for-Remote-Working/&quot; title=&quot;Our Six Tips for Remote Working&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our Six Tips for Remote Working&lt;/a&gt;), we mentioned how much we identify ourselves with the culture of remote working. It is actually one of the main pillars of our company culture, and our methodologies clearly reflect the need to be able to work from wherever we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, before that, we also wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/10/25/Dealing-With-Your-First-Hire-In-A-Distributed-Team/&quot; title=&quot;Hiring in a distributed team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hiring in a distributed team&lt;/a&gt; and even in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/04/13/Lessons-Learned-One-Year-Running-Our-Own-Business/&quot; title=&quot;Lessons Learnt at MarsBased in our first year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lessons Learnt&lt;/a&gt; post from a couple of months back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of us spent a good ten days in Berlin, the capital of Germany, and this has been our experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The best&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about working remotely from Berlin is the city itself. Berlin offers a vast variety of places for every taste. Hence, it is not surprising that the choice of places one can work from is also very rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are places for absolutely everyone: traditional east-German bakeries, sunny terraces near the river, comfy brunch places, themed coffee shops and even secret bars (we spent a night hunting for them!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, we didn&amp;#39;t even bother to look out for coworking places, even if we came across really cool ones while walking around the city. We preferred working from coffee shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While coworking spaces offer more stable connections and a perhaps less noisy environments, we wanted to keep away from real offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from cafés has also got a lot of advantages: they usually have really good food, serve tasty coffee, require no paperwork or signups and you also get to interact with their crew, which for the most part, are the kindest people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The worst&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologically speaking, Berlin could do much better. Not only are credit cards not accepted virtually anywhere city, but also good wifi is hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the credit card issue can be solved with extra cash, the wifi can be a pain in the neck. For instance, we rented an apartment on AirBnB that allegedly had a very fast wifi. Far from that, the connection was useless: we could not even browse, and it was limited to just two devices. Having brought two computers, two smartphones, an iPad and a Kindle, the house connection was completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily enough, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foursquare.com&quot; title=&quot;Foursquare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt; has a very good tag for &amp;quot;places to work&amp;quot; when browsing coffee shops &amp;amp; bakeries. Also, the user reviews tend to include the username/password of the wifi, as well as the connection speed and the amount of outlets available, therefore making it a priceless tool when searching for a place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, most places had an average wifi, but stable enough to work. Some of them had even the port 22 (developer stuff: SSH connection) blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The best places&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried a fair share of different places during our ten days there. Some we found from an extensive Google search, others from wandering around and browsing Foursquare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our stay, we actually required a good and stable connection to test &amp;amp; launch our latest project &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eureka-experts.com&quot; title=&quot;Eureka Startups Experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eureka Startups Experts&lt;/a&gt;. Eureka Startups Experts is a platform to hire experts online through video call, who will assess you on your business. Therefore, we needed to test video calls every now and then, and a good &amp;amp; stable wifi was required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the best three we have found (and wholeheartedly recommend) in order of preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Olso Kaffebar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right in the confluence between the districts of Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg, close to Nordbahnhof (in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oslokaffebar.com/contact/&quot; title=&quot;Oslo Kaffebar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eichendorffstr. 13&lt;/a&gt;), is where you will find one of the best places to work from in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oslokaffebar.com/&quot; title=&quot;Oslo Kaffebar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oslo Kaffebar&lt;/a&gt; is run by expats, so you will be able to order in English without a problem, and the staff is super friendly. Moreover, we thoroughly enjoyed our visits there because of their musical taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wifi was blazing fast and we had no trouble whatsoever using it, even when the place was packed with people working. The main drawback is that the port 22 was blocked, and we needed to go somewhere else to find it open, but it&amp;#39;s a minor issue if you&amp;#39;re not a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few outlets to plug your laptop and a scarce but delicious variety of sandwiches. We (almost) didn&amp;#39;t even mind that there were only vegetarian options. The coffee, on the other hand, is probably the best you can find in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super recommended place, a real winner, and not only to work. The terrace and the park in front of Oslo, makes it a really cool place to spend your afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. Distrikt Coffee&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://distriktcoffee.de/&quot; target=&quot;Distrikt Coffee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Distrikt Coffee&lt;/a&gt; is not appearing in any list of great places to work from in Berlin, and it&amp;#39;s hard to believe. We actually found it by chance while hunting for an open port 22 near Oslo Kaffebar, so it&amp;#39;s also in that area (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/map/distrikt-coffee-berlin-3&quot; target=&quot;Distrikt Coffee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bergstr. 68&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is huge, and has got plenty of outlets and very comfortable seats and tables, which are rare to find in Berlin. Furthermore, and for the extra points, it has some tall tables good for working while standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent only an afternoon there but the general impression was lovely: the bartenders were super gentle, the music was awesome (they were binging on The Smiths that afternoon) and both the coffee and the food were really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real winner here is the wifi connection. It was the fastest we found in the whole city. Probably one of the best-kept secrets in Berlin, and it&amp;#39;s good that it stays like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Schiller Bar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our last day in Berlin, we dropped by our buddies &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.8fit.com&quot; title=&quot;8fit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8fit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s offices in Neukolln, so we had to look for something around that area. Luckily enough, after 5 minutes wandering around, we came across the best place we found in Berlin: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schillerbar.com/&quot; title=&quot;Schiller Bar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schiller Bar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;Herrfurthstraße 7&quot; title=&quot;Schiller Bar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Herrfurthstraße 7&lt;/a&gt;. No Google, no Foursquare, just chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Àlex working in Schiller Bar&quot; title=&quot;Àlex working in Schiller Bar&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Àlex concentration level is OVER 9000!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do they have a really cool website listing everything they offer, including Google Maps&amp;#39; inner view (we sat on that blue couch!), but they were also really cool to us the whole day we spent there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few outlets here and there, plus a really fast wifi (port 22 enabled! yay!), and the place was really comfortable. Actually, comfortable enough to spend the whole day there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real highlight here is their crew and the food. The waitresses were really attentive and courteous to the only people working there (us two), and cooked the most delicious food. The Schnitzel Wiener Art was really tasty, and so were the sandwiches and coffees we had for breakfast. Schiller became our favourite place in Berlin to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, a week and a half was not enough to check all the places, but we are glad to have found so many outstanding places that confirm Berlin as one of the best destinations for digital nomads and remote workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you found any other cool place that isn&amp;#39;t listed here? Feel free to share it using the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Six Tips for Working Remotely</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d256.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased, we have a strongly defined company culture. We believe that in order to compete with bigger companies, smaller ventures have to define a strong company culture that attracts like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our core principles is being able to work remotely. As an officeless company, we want to be able to work from wherever we are, regardless of our location or time-zone. As long as the work gets done, who cares where did you write your code from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you wait for the second part of our blogging guide (read the first part &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/05/13/The-MarsBased-Blogging-Guide/&quot; title=&quot;The MarsBased Blogging Guide (Part 1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), you can read our team&amp;#39;s advice for working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does it mean to be officeless?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that are 100% digital and do not require a big physical infrastructure such as storage, a lab, servers, or other machinery, can perfectly exist without having an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An office requires maintenance, paying more bills, hiring basic services (phone, internet, water, A/C, etc.) and generally increases the number of chores that most small companies cannot afford to spend nor their money neither their time in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some companies have adopted this lifestyle and work from home, some others have become digital nomads, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.8fit.com&quot; title=&quot;8fit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8fit&lt;/a&gt;, that travel together around the world, building their product from awesome places such as Bali, Berlin or the Canary Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Javi working from a plane&quot; title=&quot;Javi working from a plane&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Javi working from a plane. Sky-high quality code!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, for one, like to work from home and take advantage of this flexibility by moving around. For instance, it&amp;#39;s cheaper to travel during the week, so we might fly for a weekend off to Italy on Wednesday, and work from there during Thursday and Friday, and then spend the whole weekend enjoying the vacation, instead of packing up last minute and waiting for delayed or overbooked flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having no office has some downsides, but also many advantages. We will cover this in future blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why are we a distributed team?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies might prefer it the other way, but we were adamant that our company would be 100% remote from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a service provider, working mostly with SaaS and cloud-based solutions, we do not require anything more than a laptop and an Internet connection (all of which we can have at home). Moreover, we like traveling, so coding from San Francisco, Barcelona or Germany makes no difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, last week we launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eureka-experts.com&quot; title=&quot;Eureka Startups Experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eureka Startups Experts&lt;/a&gt; from Berlin. Javi and I were in the capital of Germany for 10 days of remote working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were actually the only two people directly involved in the project. So working together remotely brought a different kind of focus that isolated us from other distractions. We could round off a very safe launch for this complex project and not being in Barcelona didn&amp;#39;t make any difference whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Our team&amp;#39;s advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After over a year of working remotely from awesome places like Munich or Berlin (Germany), the island of Hvar (Croatia) or San Francisco (USA), our team wants to share some of their tips with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote left-sided&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/jordi-squared.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jordi Vendrell&quot; title=&quot;Jordi Vendrell&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-circle&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Jordi Vendrell&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;COO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being very strict with my working hours is really important to me. I have set a fixed schedule that I try to respect every day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unlike in traditional workplaces, here I can start working earlier than most people if I predict interruptions throughout the afternoon. It&#39;s very usual for me to start working at 6:30 or 7:00 am if I know I&#39;ll have to take care of urgent matters after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Also, I believe it&#39;s equally important to go out for a while after work. Exercising or going for a walk can do wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote right-sided&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/xavier.png&quot; alt=&quot;Xavier Simó&quot; title=&quot;Xavier Simó&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-circle&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Xavier Simó&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Developer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By working remotely, you spend way too much time indoors. I try to go for a walk twice a day: once during the lunch break and the second right after work, to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Besides that, I also try to identify all possible distractions that might interrupt me before focusing on big tasks ahead. This way, I can prevent them, put them off or even deal with them before their time, so that nothing breaks my concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote left-sided&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/xavi-squared.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Xavier Redó&quot; title=&quot;Xavier Redó&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-circle&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Xavier Redó&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CTO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I also find it essential to wind down by going for a walk. In my case, I prefer to do it early in the morning, before kicking off the day, to go out for bread or coffee, or simply to breath some fresh air. Just go out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also important to get your daily dose of daylight. People benefit from daylight as it has a direct effect on your mood. I highly recommend working by daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, it&#39;s important to think outside of the box. Dare to be different: most people carry their habits from their previous corporate job into their new setup.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breaking these mental barriers makes you enjoy your job much more. For instance, you can program while drinking a cold beer, blasting loud music, planning your next week sitting in the balcony, or even reordering your day and going out for groceries at noon, in order to be more productive later in the day. All that matters is that these little things make you more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote right-sided&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fotografía.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;David Gómez&quot; title=&quot;David Gómez&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-circle&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;David Gómez&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Developer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One thing that works well for me is splitting my day in two with a pause to practice sport. I try to work out using my stationary bicycle or going to the gym in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I too find it very important to dress accordingly when working, avoiding pyjamas and slippers. This is one of the main things I learnt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/remote/&quot; title=&quot;Remote: No Office Required&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Remote: No Office Required&lt;/a&gt; and have strictly incorporated this in my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote left-sided&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/javi-squared.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Javier Pérez&quot; title=&quot;Javier Pérez&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-circle&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Javier Pérez&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Developer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When choosing my workplace, I need to make sure there&#39;s direct sunlight and street view. Both things make it a more pleasant environment for me, and they make me feel more energized.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Actually, being able to see what&#39;s happening in the street allows me to change focus and stop staring at the screen for a while. As a developer, I get a high amount of screen-time, so I need to rest my eyes every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My ideal workplace does definitely not look like an office. The farther from an office it looks, the more I like it, so coffee shops and libraries are where you will find me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote right-sided&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/alex-squared.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-circle&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Àlex Rodríguez&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CMO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m working on the sales area, so I get lots of interruptions from outside the company (phone calls, unsolicited emails, events, etc.). Most of them require immediate or short-term attention, so rarely ever I work on tasks that need more than one hour of focus and break down everything to work on short but intense sprints. I leave long tasks for night-time, when no one&#39;s around.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I also find it very challenging to go out and explore a new place to work from every week. That helps me break the routine and discover really cool places.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover, I spend most of the day meeting clients or going to events, so sometimes I can&#39;t go back home between meetings. I always browse &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foursquare.com&quot; title=&quot;Foursquare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt; to find good working places nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>How to Create a Damn Good Blog Post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d224.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased, we are always learning new stuff. Running your own company means being constantly in the loop of learning things you could have never predicted you would ever need. Among other stuff, we have learnt how to run a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a thing or two we have learnt along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After over a year of blogging for MarsBased and other sites, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barcelonaventures.com/blog/&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Ventures blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barcelona Ventures&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lexrodba&quot; title=&quot;@Lexrodba Medium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my personal Medium&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;ve learned a thing or two that I wanted to share with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Choose a good title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start off from the very beginning: the title. Nowadays titles do not only have to be understandable by humans, but by robots too. And while we don&amp;#39;t refer to robots like &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/21/1392977241047/Robot-from-The-Terminator-010.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Robot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141005032524/deadliestfiction/images/e/eb/Optimus_Prime_Generation_1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Robot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s always a good idea to let Google bots and the rest of web crawlers &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; that title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you&amp;#39;re writing a guide on how to craft good blog posts you might want to go with &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;How To Craft Good Posts For Your Blog&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;10 Useful Tips For Writing a Blog&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;. Choosing a title like &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Disentangling the Unfathomable Nature of Swordbuckling in the Interwebs&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; probably won&amp;#39;t get you very far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Titles should be meaningful, just like the first sentence of the post. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bufferapp.com/headline-formulas?utm_content=buffer144c3&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot; title=&quot;Buffer blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Readers absorb the first and last three words of a sentence&lt;/a&gt;, so make them count. Also, avoid clickbait titles (&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;I Unboxed My iPhone and I Couldn&amp;#39;t Believe What Happened Next&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;) where possible. They&amp;#39;re not worth it: they might earn you a thousand followers today, but all will be gone tomorrow if you don&amp;#39;t deliver what&amp;#39;s promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, titles should include your keywords. If you&amp;#39;re blogging about gadgets, include the words &lt;i&gt;wearables&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tech&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;smartphones&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;gadgets&lt;/i&gt;, etc. This will help SEO and thus increase your blog&amp;#39;s visibility. Ideally, post titles &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/ideal-blog-post-length/&quot; title=&quot;Marketing tips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t exceed 60 characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Catch your reader&amp;#39;s attention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sentences of a post are crucial. As we stated before, they really do count to make a good impression and make clear what is the post about. They usually are the ones before the &amp;quot;Read more&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post19a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Read more text&quot; title=&quot;Read more text&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Meerkat&amp;#39;s Medium account did pretty well here: placed their name, announced they&amp;#39;re an open platform and dropped keywords for developers.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the first sentences of a post count a lot for SEO, just like titles do. Some search engines will also index a snippet of the text, and that will be the first sentences. Also, when you share a blog post to Twitter or Facebook, a snippet of the text is included. Make the most out of it: keywords, facts &amp;amp; figures, a shocking anecdote...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just like titles, the first sentences must be an open invite to click on the post and continue reading, while clickbait is strongly discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the definition of good content is, as Guy Kawasaki put it, &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-london-hosted-guy-kawasaki-canvaex-apple#/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind hosts Guy Kawasaki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;content worth sharing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t emphasize enough how important a blog is for SEO. A blog allows you to have original content (yay!), on a regular basis (double yay!) that can be commented and shared, and therefore spread through the web (triple yay!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, your company name will be spread throughout the web if you do it right. Choose your keywords wisely (don&amp;#39;t overbloat it, though!) and make it worth sharing. Then, your readers will do the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting tip: if you talk about companies or individuals in your post, it&amp;#39;s a good idea to link to their website. For the extra points, you can mention them in the social networks and maybe earn some extra retweets/likes/shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of the Internet, backlinking was a good idea. Back then, blogs and sites alike paid one another to have a link to their site, whatever the content was, just to pass onto one another visitors and page rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the reality is very different. &lt;a href=&quot;http://white.net/blog/high-risk-seo-33-ways-to-get-penalised-by-google/&quot; title=&quot;Google Penalises Backlinks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google penalises that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have a dog in the fight, but we like to link other sites if we mention them. Not only to reference a quote, give other people credit, or also to help the reader find more interesting stuff outside of our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that you don&amp;#39;t want your users to leave your page for good, so instead of adding a regular link to ease the transition from your blog post to an external website, just add the &lt;i&gt;target=_blank&lt;/i&gt; HTML attribute so that the new page opens in a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likewise important to add a good title attribute to your link, to help crawlers and users alike to understand the nature of the link. In this case, if we want to link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.buffer.com&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&#39;s Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buffer&amp;#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;ll do it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.buffer.com&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&#39;s Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Read Buffer&#39;s Blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our favourite bloggers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnrampton.com/&quot; title=&quot;John Rampton website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Rampton&lt;/a&gt;, who writes kickass posts for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.entrepreneur.com&quot; title=&quot;Entrepreneur-com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Entrepreneur.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://forbes.com&quot; title=&quot;Forbes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; told us to use the first three links of a blog post to link your previous posts when possible. We didn&amp;#39;t find it suitable for this post, but most of the times it can fit in pretty well and will encourage newcomers to your blog to read your previous articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each blog post needs to have at least one image. Do not skip this part, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images help readability and can help better explain a concept. Remember that &amp;quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&amp;quot;. Good examples of this are: a good infography, a picture of the crowded event you hosted or a nice shot of your new offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images will also be fetched by RSS feeds and the sharing widgets of your favourite social networks, so make sure it&amp;#39;s well displayed there. As a matter of fact, Tweets and Facebook posts with images receive more engagement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bufferapp.com/twitter-images&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&#39;s Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;according to Buffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the tech side, images need to have their &lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;title&lt;/i&gt; attributes being as descriptive as possible. This will ultimately reflect on your SEO. Here&amp;#39;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;http://route.to/image&quot; alt=&quot;A group shot of the MarsBased team&quot; title=&quot;A group shot of the MarsBased team&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Readability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use subtitles to distribute the reading rhythm along the post. One long post with no subtitles is harder to follow; whereas a well-structured blog post with evenly-divided sub-sections will help to maintain the reader&amp;#39;s focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtitles, when correctly marked using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, help crawlers index the page&amp;#39;s content much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Style&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect blog post length is thought to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitrebels.com/social/makes-perfect-blog-post-infographic/&quot; title=&quot;Infographic about blogging&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around 1200 words&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very important that you double-check your post thoroughly for typos, broken links, unformatted parts or unreferenced quotes. Mediocre or poorly processed posts seldom get shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this last case, remember what was the last blog post you read and thought &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to share this one&amp;quot;. Why did you do it? Was it the pictures? Was it funny? Was it because someone important wrote it? No. Most of the time you share it because you feel like more people should read it, and you either send it to specific people or you spread it on the web by sharing it through Twitter, Facebook or your social networks of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a good idea to re-read the post 3 o 4 times prior to publishing, and it&amp;#39;s even more advisable to ask your team or another person to read it. What&amp;#39;s obvious to you, it might not be for everyone. A concept might need further explanation, some typos go unnoticed by spell-checkers (&lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;you&amp;#39;re&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; vs &lt;i&gt;than&lt;/i&gt;) or you might have left a sentence unfinished (these things happen, but at MarsBased we alwa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Call to action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the post should have a &lt;i&gt;raison d&amp;#39;être&lt;/i&gt;: it can be an informative post, a how-to guide, an opinion to give food for thought, or an invitation to the new beta version of your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the aim of the post is, it should conclude with a call to action. A call to action (often referred to as CTA) is an instruction to the audience to provoke an immediate response, usually using an imperative verb such as &amp;quot;call now&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;find out more&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;visit a store today&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://homebusiness.about.com/od/homebusinessglossar1/g/Call-To-Action-Definition.htm&quot; title=&quot;Definition of call to action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). If you don&amp;#39;t know what call to action you should do, the message of your post might not be clear enough, yet you can always ask the audience to share the post around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want an example of call to action? We&amp;#39;ll wrap up the post with one!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons Learnt: One Year Running Our Own Business</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d195.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time flies. We have been so busy this year, that we have barely had time to look back to all the things we have accomplished thus far. Actually, it’s been a year and a month since &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/03/30/Celebrating-the-first-Martian-year/&quot; title=&quot;Celebrating the First Martian Year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we legally founded MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the companies we look up to is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dockyard.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dockyard&quot;&gt;Dockyard&lt;/a&gt;. They run a very inspirational blog, where they publish their experiences. This is a small homage to them and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/opinion/2012/06/21/lessons-learned-six-month-of-running-dockyard.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dockyard Blog&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post, where they described the difficulties they faced during the first six months running a consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we have learnt in this first year of operating full-time as service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/post18.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keep Calm And Trust MarsBased&quot; title=&quot;Keep Calm And Trust MarsBased&quot; class=&quot;img-center img-rounded img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Keep Calm and Trust the Martians&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Market share&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first fears we had when we created the company was that there would be no demand for customized web apps in Ruby on Rails. Ruby does not have a big market share in Spain, so we had to create it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, we have been overwhelmed by the incessant demand of Ruby development. Apparently, there’s not enough developers, nor specialized companies. We&amp;#39;ve also done a lot of technology-agnostic projects where we chose the tech stack. That means we have contributed to increasing the number of clients using Rails. You’re welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Identify the companies you want to work for and contact them or ask for an introduction. Most of them will want to hear your story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep this section short, we will publish a dedicated post about each project we have completed throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients are the essence of all consulting businesses. The difference between a successful company and a failed one often times boils down to choosing your clients right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good client can be your best asset: they talk about you, recommend you to other potential clients, give you more projects, promote your stuff, and offer better conditions over time. Actually, a happy client rarely ever changes providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a bad customer can bring your business down. People that force you to work without a contract, on abusive conditions or not paying customers pose a real threat to your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have defined your business model, and your company culture, you should also define what kind of clients do you want to have and stick to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting bad conditions now might seem a good idea if there are complicated months ahead for finding new contracts — such as summer, or Christmas time -, but it’ll prevent you from potentially finding a better client a little later in time (this is the so-called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Opportunity cost&quot;&gt;Opportunity cost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Before committing to any contract, find out what the opportunity cost is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important advice we can give here is: do not undervalue yourself. Not only because you will lose the opportunity cost (see above), but also because you are what you repeatedly do. That is, if your hourly rate is 70 euro, but you always offer friendly prices and end up working for 30 euro/hour, then you are a 30 euro/hour company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your strategy is competing with price, skip this section: we’re not a good example. But if you compete with quality, your high rates are more justified. Specialized companies/individuals charge more per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, for one, started off at 50 euro/hour, which is actually cheap for a specialized company, but we wanted to build our portfolio. The market welcomed us with open arms with that price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we have raised our fee. We need to filter out the number of opportunities we get each month and we have a larger team now. Strange as it might seem, our ideal clients might not want to hire us if they perceive we are “too cheap”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: do not start with a lower fee than you’d normally charge. Once you have got a client, it’s not easy to increase your rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Company culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This. Is. Key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably because we look up to companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoughtbot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Thoughtbot website&quot;&gt;Thoughtbot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;37Signals website&quot;&gt;37Signals (now Basecamp)&lt;/a&gt;, we always wanted to define a company culture for MarsBased right from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company culture is one of the things we always review at our board meetings, or while talking to our employees. Most of all, we try to keep the Martian culture as present as possible in our daily grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong and well-defined company culture will help you take strategic decisions, for instance, when choosing projects or clients &amp;quot;is this client aligned with my vision?&amp;quot; or when hiring &amp;quot;will this person adapt to our company environment?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Defining your company culture should be the first thing you do when creating a business. Then, make it evolve naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Methodologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things we have done - and feel more proud of - is having defined our own working methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have consistently identified workflows we incur in on a daily basis (or frequently enough) and turned them into a working methodology by identifying its bottlenecks and documenting where it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, our sales process was a bottleneck. Every time we needed to send an offer for a new project, the document had to undergo a revision by the whole team. More often than not, this revision was pushed back for over two weeks, potentially risking losing a customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified this problem, analyzed it and found some solutions to this blocking issue. After the document is ready, the whole team has two days to do their revision. If no feedback is given, we assume everything’s OK and deliver the document. This way, if somebody needs to actually work on the document, he just needs to ask for some extra time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Find one day a month to step back and revise all your workflows. Identify issues and work on them. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hiring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year ago we did not expect to hire anybody before 2014 ended. At best, we could only hope there’d be enough work to sustain the three founding members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out we had enough work to hire &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/10/18/The-MarsBased-Team-Grows-Bigger-The-Abduction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Blog post about hiring Javi&quot;&gt;Javi&lt;/a&gt; in September, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/03/24/An-Internship-Out-of-This-World/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Post about Emilio&#39;s internship&quot;&gt;Emilio&lt;/a&gt; in December and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarsBased/status/577401842105192448&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Xavier abduction into MarsBased&quot;&gt;Xavier&lt;/a&gt; in March, while outsourcing an additional 33% of our workload to companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evilmartians.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Evil Martians website&quot;&gt;Evil Martians&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mortensen.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Mortensen&quot;&gt;Mortensen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, hiring is not easy. As a consultancy, you need to focus on delivering results to your clients. There’s little to no time to do HR. We actually wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/10/25/Dealing-With-Your-First-Hire-In-A-Distributed-Team/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Blog post about hiring&quot;&gt;blog post where we spoke about this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily enough, we have friends and colleagues that have recommended potential employees to us, and everyone we have hired so far turned out to be a really good asset to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Hire only people you have worked with in the past or that you know very well. They will work harder to avoid disappointing you, and the risk of them being a flop is therefore minimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Delegate wisely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the principles we have built our company around is bootstrapping. We did not want to risk a lot of money in this, as it is our first company. So we decided to spend every penny wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great at first, when you have enough time to deal with chores, while working on small projects (or even none of them). But as a specialized company, we needed to focus on what we do best: developing apps with Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we started growing, we found out that our workload increased as well. Thus, we began delegating some tasks to external companies. Bookkeeping was the first one, then legal stuff, and now we even delegate part of our development or some of our designs to companies of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Always delegate stuff that is not imperative you keep in-house. It might save you time, and time is ultimately money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Burnout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As first-time entrepreneurs, this is tricky to handle. The founding members entrance to the company was by working part-time on weekends and spare hours until we accumulated enough cash to employ all of us. It was a slow but safe process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, we would probably do it differently now. When half of your company is working full time, and the other half only on weekends and spare hours, working schedules might not overlap. Therefore, the part-timers drag the full-timers to work longer shifts (till late night) or even on weekends, when they’re not supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, stretching your working shift today will have an impact tomorrow. It’s easier to avoid burnout if you stick to your 40 hours work week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Define a clear roadmap for the incorporations and stick to it. Try to avoid the aforementioned situation by adjusting your schedules accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we have had to learn so far is business development. Since none of us had a full sales background, we decided to have one person dedicated 100% to this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a full-time member focused on business development is something most early-stage development shops do not have. For us, it has allowed us to build a consistent image on the social networks, a blog, a good ranking on the search engines and a frequent offline presence (organizing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.cat&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, building the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2013/11/07/start-up-circle-barcelona/&quot; title=&quot;Blog post about Startup Circle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Circle&lt;/a&gt; community and attending an average of two events per week).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Sales are a service company’s fuel. Invest big time in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Estimates, guesstimates and project planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this first year, we have learnt the cultural difference of working with Spanish clients and clients from outside of Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanish clients prefer to work on a closed estimate of time and budget. A rather exhaustive document justifying how long will it take us to complete the project and a guesstimate in price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, project plannings change following users’ or investors’ opinions &amp;amp; needs, so this method is only fit for projects with a very clear and fixed scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, our clients from abroad prefer to work on a more agile way: we fix a price per hour and a number of hours per week and we start working. The project roadmap is built and rearranged every now and then during the length of the project, making it less of a hassle to change a functionality for another that was not in the original planning, thus allowing developers to focus on developing rather than doing estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons learnt&lt;/strong&gt;: So far, we have learnt to work using both methodologies, but we don’t have a dog in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What has helped us getting clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order of relevance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing Startup Grind BCN and other events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://w153.bcn.cat/&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Startup Map&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barcelona Startup Map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy clients referring us to their contacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belonging to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barcelonatechcity.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Tech City&quot;&gt;Barcelona Tech City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our referral agreement program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What has not helped us getting clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following haven’t proved 100% useful yet when looking for new clients. Probably because we haven’t devoted enough time to them or because the timing or the execution were not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold emailing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posting on LinkedIn groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using freelancing platforms (Workana, Elance, Freelancer.com…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Other small lessons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other tips we have learnt but do not deserve an own section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always meet your deadlines. Clients will often not meet theirs, but that does not spare you from doing your homework. Be always ready for unexpected changes and to help your client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous experience in consulting and management have proved useful, especially when reporting to clients and managing expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat your employees responsibly and they will behave responsibly (Basecamp&amp;#39;s Jason Fried &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/magazine/20091101/the-way-i-work-jason-fried-of-37signals.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Jason Friend&#39;s How I Work&quot;&gt;wrote about this first&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a minimum budget for projects. You don’t want to waste your client’s time, so tell them what that price is upfront.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients that don&amp;#39;t fit your company might be a right fit for others. Offer them to pass their contact onto companies/freelancers you trust. They will be very grateful for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>An Internship out of This World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain&amp;#39;s log, stardate d176.y36/AB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I completed my degree in Software Development, to begin my career in web development, I opted to go for an internship. Turns out, a good friend of mine had attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/08/22/The-Martians-conquer-the-IronHack/&quot; title=&quot;The Martians Conquer the IronHack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first Ironhack edition in Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, where he met a couple of MarsBased members and suggested that I applied for an internship here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is how I met MarsBased. Let me tell you how it went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Landing on the red planet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first day at MarsBased, they welcomed me as if we had known each other for a long time. That felt definitely relieving and took pressure off me, allowing me to learn much, work hard and make the most out of this experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working at MarsBased has definitely been radically different from what I had done in the past. For example, MarsBased is a remote working company, so we have no offices and work as a distributed team. I had no prior experience in working from home, but after trying it, I am now captivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found a company with a very solid company culture and clear goals. Everybody knows what these goals are, and what is the best way to accomplish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what I have seen, everyone brings in experiences from their previous jobs, so we all can follow best practices and avoid common mistakes. It&amp;#39;s all about the lessons learnt in the past. Sometimes you win, others you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this company, &lt;strong&gt;Martians are Martians&lt;/strong&gt;, not resources. We hold on this belief: however hard we may work, comradery is ever-present and there is always time for joking and laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Martian crew&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outwardly, MarsBased looks like a big company because of the huge workload we can cope with. In this case, however, size does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; matter. It is the Martians&amp;#39; ability to organize and communicate that&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;from another galaxy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for sure one of the most important lessons I will take with me. Organization and communication are key in a remote working company. Both skills play a key role when dealing with client work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are not a lot of rules in MarsBased, as strange as it might be. And the few of them we&amp;#39;ve got, they are really easy to follow, such as no emails, the weekly summary Basecamp post on Monday, simpler is better, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I wanted to highlight is the diversity among the team members. Despite being such a small team, there is a very diverse set of strengths and weaknesses that work like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of all the previous points, we are a very friendly, transparent, responsible and social company, while being very powerful - technologically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adapting to the environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mars, Ruby on Rails is spoken. Yet I came into the company with no prior knowledge of this framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every beginning is hard - they say - and mine was not an exception! Learning everything about routes, controllers, presenters, views, models and the rest of the jargon was not easy. It was all Greek to me. I came from a very different background, and although I could describe how to solve a problem, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to figure out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was not the worst. The red screen appearing after application errors, with a rather cryptographic error message scared the hell out of me more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days learning to prototype using mockups and some layout from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/lexrodba&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit Twitter Handle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Àlex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/jordi_vendrell&quot; title=&quot;Jordi Vendrell Farreny Twitter Handle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jordi&lt;/a&gt;, I have been working shoulder by shoulder with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/xavier_redo&quot; title=&quot;Xavier Redó Cano Twitter Handle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xavi&lt;/a&gt; most of my time in the company. He has been my guide in this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xavi is a natural born teacher. He is very good at explaining why things happen the way they do. Not only that: he&amp;#39;s extraordinarily gifted in keeping a clear discourse when he&amp;#39;s explaining technical concepts. Talking to Xavi feels like talking to an encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Xavi has been more than a teacher: he&amp;#39;s also taught me how to avoid burnout, praised my progress and cheered me up in those hard days when you can&amp;#39;t tell an Array from a Hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Back to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mars, there is no oxygen, and my reserves are now depleted. I have to keep learning how to survive in such an environment, and that will happen somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... or it might just be that I have not overcome my addiction to nachos with guacamole. You can&amp;#39;t find them on Mars, so I am coming back to the blue planet to refill my reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a farewell. It is more like a &amp;quot;see you later&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Emilio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Good luck with your new endeavour, Emilio! We&amp;#39;ll miss you!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
