    <p><em>Captain&#39;s log, stardate d176.y36/AB</em></p>

<p>Last year I completed my degree in Software Development, to begin my career in web development, I opted to go for an internship. Turns out, a good friend of mine had attended the <a href="http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/08/22/The-Martians-conquer-the-IronHack/" title="The Martians Conquer the IronHack" target="_blank">first Ironhack edition in Barcelona</a>, where he met a couple of MarsBased members, and suggested that I applied for an internship there.</p>

<p>And this is how I met MarsBased. Let me tell you how did it go!</p>

<!--more-->

<h3>Landing on the red planet</h3>

<p>On my first day at MarsBased, they welcomed me as if we had known each other for a long time. That felt definitely relieving and took pressure off me, allowing me to learn much, work hard and make the most out of this experience.</p>

<p>Working at MarsBased has definitely been radically different from what I had done in the past. For example, MarsBased is a remote working company, so we have no offices and work as a distributed team. I had no prior experience in working from home, but after trying it, I am now captivated.</p>

<p>I also found a company with a very solid company culture and clear goals. Everybody knows what these goals are, and what is the best way to accomplish them.</p>

<p>For what I have seen, everyone brings in experiences from their previous jobs, so we all can follow best practices and avoid common mistakes. It&#39;s all about the lessons learnt in the past. Sometimes you win, others you learn.</p>

<!--
Or simply put, using Rails, this is the <strong>MarsBased formula</strong>:


<pre>
<code>[1] pry(main)> positive_experiences - negative_experiences + ideal_company
[
    [0] "marsbased"
]</code>
</pre>
!-->

<p>In this company, <strong>Martians are Martians</strong>, not resources. We hold on this belief: however hard we may work, comradery is ever-present and there is always time for joking and laughing.</p>

<h3>The Martian crew</h3>

<p>Outwardly, MarsBased looks like a big company because of the huge workload we can cope with. In this case, however, size does <i>not</i> matter. It is the Martians&#39; ability to organize and communicate that&#39;s <i>from another galaxy</i>.</p>

<p>This is for sure one of the most important lessons I will take with me. Organization and communication are key in a remote working company. Both skills play a key role when dealing with client work.</p>

<p>There are not a lot of rules in MarsBased, as strange as it might be. And the few of them we&#39;ve got, they are really easy to follow, such as no emails, the weekly summary Basecamp post on Monday, simpler is better, and so on.</p>

<p>Another thing I wanted to highlight is the diversity among the team members. Despite being such a small team, there is a very diverse set of strenghts and weaknesses that work like a charm.</p>

<p>As a result of all the previous points, we are a very friendly, transparent, responsible and social company, while being very powerful - technologically speaking.</p>

<h3>Adapting to the environment</h3>

<p>On Mars, Ruby on Rails is spoken. Yet I came into the company with no prior knowledge of this framework.</p>

<p>Every beginning is hard - they say - and mine was not an exception! Learning everything about routes, controllers, presenters, views, models and the rest of the jargon was not easy. It was all Greek to me. I came from a very different background, and although I could describe how to solve a problem, I wasn&#39;t able to figure out how to do it.</p>

<p>But that was not the worst. The red screen appearing after application errors, with a rather cryptographic error message scared the hell out of me more than once.</p>

<p>After a few days learning prototyping using mockups and some layout from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lexrodba" title="Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit Twitter Handle" target="_blank">Àlex</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jordi_vendrell" title="Jordi Vendrell Farreny Twitter Handle" target="_blank">Jordi</a>, I have been working shoulder by shoulder with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/xavier_redo" title="Xavier Redó Cano Twitter Handle" target="_blank">Xavi</a> most of my time in the company. He has been my guide in this journey.</p>

<p>Xavi is a natural born teacher. He is very good at explaining why things happen the way they do. Not only that: he&#39;s extraordinarily gifted in keeping a clear discourse when he&#39;s explaining technical concepts. Talking to Xavi feels like talking to an encyclopedia.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Xavi has been more than a teacher: he&#39;s also taught me how to avoid burnout, praised my progress and cheered me up in those hard days when you can&#39;t tell an Array from a Hash.</p>

<h3>Back to Earth</h3>

<p>On Mars there is no oxygen, and my reserves are now depleted. I have to keep learning how to survive in such an environment, and that will happen somewhere else.</p>

<p>... or it might just be that I have not overcome my addiction to nachos with guacamole. You can&#39;t find them on Mars, so I am coming back to the blue planet to refill my reserves.</p>

<p>This is not a farewell. It is more like a &quot;see you later&quot;.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the ride!</p>

<p>- Emilio</p>
