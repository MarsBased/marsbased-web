#MarsBased

This is the public repository that serves our Jekyll powered website through
GitHub Pages. As GitHub pages doesn't allow custom libs and we use a
couple of them we keep the *master* branch as our development branch and the
*gh-pages* branch as the deploy branch with only static content.

## Who we are?
MarsBased is an application development company highly specialized in Ruby on Rails, based in Barcelona.

We build our apps using Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Elastic search and other awesome state-of-the-art technologies, while applying agile development methodologies. With all these tools under our belt, we can build a killer app for you!

We are a development company with the DNA of a startup. Largely inspired by the Lean Startup methodology, we craft our applications the artisan way while getting involved with your company, building elegant and high-quality solutions. More than a provider, we become your partner all throughout the project.

If you want us to develop for you, send us an e-mail with your idea and we will contact you ASAP.
