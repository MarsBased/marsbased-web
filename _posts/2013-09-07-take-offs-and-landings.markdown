With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcyuKUtgyZ8" title="David Bowie - Space Oddity" target="_blank">Bowie's "Space Oddity</a> on our minds, we packed a few personal belongings and lots of illusion, took our luggages and set off onto a new start.

And here we are: inside our spaceship, heading towards our new destination. Life's too good up here. It is, indeed, a promising start for our trip to a brighter future.
