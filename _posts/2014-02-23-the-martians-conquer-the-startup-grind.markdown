*Captain's log, stardate d461.y35/AB*

It's been two weeks since we attended the famous <a href="http://startupgrind.com/2014" title="Startup Grind" target="_blank">Startup Grind</a> Global Summit in Mountain View, California, and we already look forward to next year's edition!

If you are not familiar with the <a href="http://startupgrind.com/" title="Startup Grind" target="_blank">Startup Grind</a>, it's a recurring monthly event that aims to educate, inspire and connect entrepreneurs worldwide. The Startup Grind is a growing community in over 70 cities in 30 different countries, powered by <a href="http://www.google.com/entrepreneurs/" title="Google for Entrepreneurs" target="_blank">Google for Entrepreneurs</a>.

People coming from all over the world travelled all the way to Mountain View to represent their start-ups or businesses. Investors, CEOs, developers, marketers, hackers, and all sorts of entrepreneurs attended the gathered in the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" title="Computer History Musem" target="_blank">Computer History Musem</a>, that hosted the event.

There, we learnt the three Startup Grind principles:

<p class="text-center img-footer"><small>The Startup Grind Values</small></p>

As Martians, and newcomers, we found these principles to be particularly welcoming. Want to know how do we apply them? Keep reading!

###How do we help others###

First and foremost, we offer to be your development company. We are highly specialized in Ruby on Rails and the tech stack we wrote about in <a href="http://www.marsbased.com/blog/2014/02/01/we-make-the-right-app2/" title="Our last blog entry" target="_blank">our last blog entry</a>. We guide you from the very birth of your business idea to its launch, by applying our knowledge and experience on the field of web apps.

We can help your business if you...

* ... have no know-how to develop web applications.
* ... need some guidance/counseling to define what you app need.
* ... want to partner with a trustworthy development company.

For individuals or start-ups, we build your MVPs. MarsBased has the DNA of a start-up and that gives us a deep understanding of what do start-ups need.

###How do we make friends###

We met a lot of people. Really. And we remember each and everyone's faces and names. We enjoyed a good chat with everybody and look forward to meeting them again, wherever they live.

Because we enjoy keeping track of their endeavours, we connected with them on the social networks. We are always open to meet new people, so feel free to connect with <a href="http://www.marsbased.com/contact" title="Our social profiles" target="_blank">our social profiles</a> and let's start a good conversation!

But you can also meet us in real life by shooting us an e-mail. If we're not around your area, we will schedule a video call.

You know, for being Martians, we are actually very down-to-earth guys ;)

###Giving before taking###

Giving before taking is one of the principles of altruism. And what is more altruistic than trying to change the world?

The Startup Grind guys came with a very nice initiative: the world-changing wall. All the attendees were encouraged to write how is their company changing the world.

MarsBased is composed by three Martians driven to change the consultancy world for the better. We want to make consultancy friendly, fun, and down-to-earth.

The usage of lean techniques, agile development methodologies, the "simpler is better" philosophy and our charming presence are giving our consulting services a fresher touch. Our clients are already enjoying this closer approach.
