So some of you want to know what's going on in the MarsBased headquarters, right? We can not reveal much, but we can tell you we're indeed *cookin'* something!

Let us introduce you to "Cookin.me". Cookin.me is our soon-to-be first product, consisting in a web application for managing cooking recipes.

Cookin.me features an easy, clean and intuitive user interface that will help you organize your cooking recipes the way you want: create cookbooks and move recipes between them. The smooth transitions provide a pleasant experience when combined with in-line editing. You will breeze through your recipes collection!

If you want to try Cookin.me, you will need to wait a little longer. We're currently finishing the development, and completely changing the way it looks. We are adapting to the newest and trendiest *look&feels* and opted for a flat design.

It looks awesome, actually, but if you want to see it, you'll need to stay alert in the social networks or else subscribe to our newsletter!

*"Ok, ok, I got it, but why another recipe app in the market?"*

There are currently heaps of recipe applications in the market: but none of them features such a beautiful user interface. Believe us, after analysing the market, we felt there was something missing in each and every recipe app we've tested. Loads of button-bloated toolbars, excessive functionality, old-fashioned look&feels, last-century table-based designs, pixelated logos and imagery, etc.

Why so complicated?

We think differently: Simpler is better. We prefer releasing a product that does half the things but works as intended, rather than a half a product working 50% of the time.

But that's not all we do: we, at MarsBased, enjoy creating our own products as well as working for others (preferably small businesses) as long as they fit in with the MarsBased philosophy: simpler is better, global products, effective designs, state-of-the-art technologies.

For the moment, though, we've just started building up relationships around the net. As a starting company, we have been walking the initial steps of creating a company: defining strategies, building a splash website, creating a corporate image and learning to work together. As a matter of fact, we've launched our website and our social profiles barely two weeks ago!

But we want more! We've already started making some noise 'round the net! If you want to be the first to read our messages and keep updated on our endeavours, try following us in the social networks:

Tell us and we might include it as a feature, and you will be eligible for being a beta tester!
