###The Martians attend Startup Grind Barcelona###

On Friday, 13th we attended the first Startup Grind Barcelona event held in the Mobile World Centre, right in the heart of Barcelona. As you might already know, we’re the technological partner of Startup Grind Barcelona (check out their <a href="http://startupgrind.cat/" title="Startup Grind Barcelona's website" target="_blank">website</a>!).

There, our soon-to-be-disclosed CTO presented our latest project: <a href="http://bcn.cat/bcnstartupmap" title="Barcelona Startup Map" target="_blank">Barcelona Startup Map</a>. Here’s some impressions!

###The event###

More than 50 people witnessed the presentation of the map. First time entrepreneurs, long running freelancers, investors and a very diverse audience saw the possibilities of this webapp that connects the whole Barcelona Startup Ecosystem.

We did this tour of the app amidst other very interesting presentations on the event’s topic: entrepreneurship in sport. We presented after Oriol Serra (Nektria) and Guillermo Llibre (Gymforless).

Startup Grind is always open to the community, and anybody is entitled to present their interesting projects to the entrepreneurial community.

###By the community, for the community###

Barcelona Startup Map was first conceived as a tool to enable all the actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Barcelona to interact with each other, by being able to find one another in a map.

This way, start-ups can find all the similar businesses in their area, and other services of they might need. For instance, let’s suppose our friends at Dineyo (red marker) are looking for investment in their own neighborhood. They can filter by the Investors typology and zoom in their area. There, they will find Nauta Capital.

Now it’s up to them to convince Nauta Capital to lend them some money! We can’t help any further with the map :)
