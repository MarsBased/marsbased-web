So the start-up circle we've been talking about on Twitter is already working! It's a small step for the start-up community in Barcelona, but a huge step for MarsBased!

Don't you know what a start-up circle is? Well, plain and simple: it's a group of start-ups that collaborate together. Of course, there are be start-ups that share co-working spaces, computers, work on the same project or even share board – just to name a couple of variations. The bottom line is: collaboration at *any* level.

In our case, our start-up circle consists of four start-ups and a start-up-less entrepreneur. They are, in no particular order:

All of the mentioned above are based in Barcelona!

The Sagrada Família, in Barcelona, home of our start-up circle.

The start-up circle has one only goal: to help each start-up to save time, not otherwise. It should allow each start-up to focus on their strengths, rather than wasting time in trying to overcome their weaknesses.

Each and every member of this start-up circle has identified what are the weak and strong points of their teams. If we had the means, we'd probably delegate them to third parties, but we're <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping" title="Bootstrapping definition from Wikipedia" target="_blank">bootstrapping</a>.

Because we're on a budget, and most start-ups are, we need to get things going using our imagination as a substitute for money. Or else, as a tool to get money and/or resources.

A start-up circle can help its members in many ways:

* **Knowledge sharing:** Through creation of manuals, exchanging formation (workshops, webinars, etc.) or on-line documentation – such as wikis.
* **Resource sharing:** Co-working spaces, shared equipment (cars, computers, servers…), placing orders together, etc.
* **Exchange of favours:** A company whose best asset is creating beautiful designs can offer their designs to an other start-up circle member offering legal assistance in return
* **Networking:** Everyone needs to build their own contacts network. But why not doing it while being part of a network? A net's worth isn't just the sum of all its members, as stated by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law" title="Metcalfe's law" target="_blank">Metcalfe's law</a> (and many others), but it grows with the network in a non-linear way.
Of course, there are more benefits in belonging to a start-up circle, but these are the most important to us right now.

In our case, the start-up circle can help us in the legal area, as well as in the administration and accounting ones. We can rely on some of the other circle members whose strengths are, precisely, these ones.

Conversely, we offer our expertise in web design, technical knowledge and international capabilities in return. We do believe we're able to deliver quality products and therefore share our know-how with the rest of the start-up circle members.
