Slack is the new trend in online communications. Given its free-for-all policy, all kinds of companies adopted it as their de facto communication platform. Slack is <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3042326/tech-forecast/with-500000-users-slack-says-its-the-fastest-growing-business-app-ever" title="Fast Company article about Slack" target="_blank">quickly becoming a communication standard</a>.

In fact, after companies, now is the turn for communities to use it to engage with their current members and attract new ones. Communities such as <a href="https://nomadlist.com/" title="Nomad List" target="_blank">Nomad List</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.link/" title="Ruby on Rails community" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, Ebay employees and many others are some of the best examples of online Slack communities. There are some great individuals compiling lists of Slack communities, such as this <a href="https://medium.com/@angiecois/an-incomplete-list-of-communities-on-slack-1b1b6f157bda" title="An incomplete list of communities on Slack" target="_blank">almost exhaustive one</a>, created by Angela Cois.

We're excited to announce the launch of a Slack Community for <strong>all</strong> Barcelona startups and entrepreneurs.

###Why Slack?###

Buffer wrote <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/slack-community" title="Buffer's guide to Slack" target="_blank">a very useful guide about it</a>, so we don't have to.

There are many reasons why we chose Slack, but the main one is the market share it has already got, so the cost of changing is little to none. Slack supports multi-team sign-in, therefore making it easy to switch from one team to another. In the following picture you can see my Slack (notice the left bar, where each icon is a Slack team):

<p class="text-center img-footer"><small>I'm on 9 teams! Nine interesting teams just a keyboard shortcut away!</small></p>

Furthermore, Slack has got really cool mobile apps. You can chat from your phone or tablet, from wherever you are, irrespective of the device you're using. This is a fundamental feature for a distributed team like ours.

Slack also offers a huge flexibility on how to use it. Pinned documents, search, mentions, file sharing, integrations with dozens of interesting services and other killer features make Slack a safe bet.

###How will we use it?###

Our main goal is to become the largest Slack community in Barcelona for entrepreneurs & startups. We will connect entrepreneurs that want to help each other and share relevant content <strong>in real time</strong> with the different communities in Barcelona.

At <a href="http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona" title="Startup Grind Barcelona" target="_blank">Startup Grind Barcelona</a> we offer the first hour of the event to our attendees, and we call it the <i>Community Hour</i>. The best example for that is our Open Mic session, where 10-15 entrepreneurs per event come on stage to ask help for their project and offer something in return.

Our attendees have asked for very different things: a cofounder, a CTO, investment, some growthhacking ideas, mentoring and even translators. In return, they have offered consulting, free services, promotional items and all sorts of cool stuff.

Therefore, we created a give/take channel to move this interesting exchange online, so you don't have to wait for the next event. You will never miss that interesting person who spoke at the Open Mic but you didn't get to talk to. You can find them in our Slack community!

Not only that, our attendees can also send questions in real time to the speaker during the fireside chat, or live-comment the interview and/or the event.

As we will grow the number of users, we will listen to what they want, and adapt the Slack community to them. If they want a channel to offer jobs, or to bring in a new community, or engage with influencers, or any other need, we will try to meet their needs.

###Community Giveback###

At MarsBased, we feel very attached to the Barcelona entrepreneurial community. Not only did we run for almost two years the <a href="http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/09/21/Five-Reasons-Why-Your-Company-Should-Organise-an-Event/" title="Startup Circle, by MarsBased" target="_blank">Startup Circle</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarsBased/status/391521920858214400" title="MarsBased Tweet about Startup Circle" target="_blank">here's our tweet announcing it back then!</a>) but we're also behind Startup Grind Barcelona.

With Startup Circle we brought together a community of 50 individuals & companies that met once or twice a month to help one another and socialise. That was our door to entrepreneurship, and we hope it has helped other people as well.

Since March 2014 we're also running Startup Grind in Barcelona, with the help of some brilliant people such as <a href="http://startupgrind.cat/contact/" title="Startup Grind team" target="_blank">Carlos Cruz, Alex Gonzalez and a team of volunteers</a>.

This is part of our program to give back to the community that helped us grow when we started. This is often known as <i>Community Giveback.</i>

###Embracing all communities###

However, this is not a tool just for Startup Grind members. We want to open it up to the whole Barcelona startup community.

We believe that the Barcelona startup community needs more interaction among its members. After all, active communities must become ecosystems. But an ecosystem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Wikipedia definition of Ecosystem" target="_blank">according to Wikipedia</a>, is
<i> a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system</i>.

If all the actors in the Barcelona startup scene are to interact with one another, they need a common comunication channel. We are happy to provide it.
