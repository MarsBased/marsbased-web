We are very happy to announce that two days ago we launched our biggest project to date. Together with the Barcelona City Hall and Barcelona Activa - the executive tool of the Economic Development policies of the Barcelona City Council - we launched <a href="http://bcn.cat/bcnstartupmap" title="Barcelona Startup Map" target="_blank">Barcelona Startup Map</a>.

###We support the Barcelona local scene###

Barcelona Startup Map is a web application that displays the current state of the Barcelona entrepreneurial ecosystem in a map. Through Barcelona Startup Map, you will be able to find, geolocate and add start-ups, investors, accelerators/incubators, talent centers and venues providing services to entrepreneurs.

Barcelona Startup Map, like <a href="http://www.spainstartupmap.com/" title="SpainStartupMap" target="_blank">SpainStartupMap</a>, <a href="http://techbritain.com/" title="TechBritain" target="_blank">TechBritain</a>, <a href="http://www.mappedinisrael.com/" title="MappedInIsrael" target="_blank">MappedInIsrael</a> and similar initiatives, provides a quick overview of the resources available to entrepreneurs in a certain area or city. Simply, if investors want to know whether the Barcelona start-up scene is solid enough, they will load Barcelona Startup Map to get the picture. To help the visitor understand the mapped data quicker and further, we are adding infographics as more data is brought into the system.

For now, the platform is only available to companies and individuals based in Barcelona. If the platform is well received, though, it will evolve to incorporate all the Metropolitan Area surrounding Barcelona or even a larger area.

###Presentation at BizBarcelona###

Barcelona Startup Map was made publicly available during the <a href="http://www.bizbarcelona.com/" title="BizBarcelona" target="_blank">BizBarcelona</a>. An institutional presentation speech was made by Sònia Recasens (Deputy Mayor of Barcelona) stating the good health of the entrepreneurial scene in Barcelona. Itziar Blasco (head of new incubation models at Barcelona Activa) did shortly afterwards a quick demo of the app, showing all its possibilities.

Because both <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2162027/Microsofts-Surface-tablet-crashes-stage--repeat-Bill-Gates-Windows-98-blue-screen-death-moment.html" title="Microsoft FAIL" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzDDO3Xb_QU" title="Apple FAIL" target="_blank">Apple</a> had major FAIL moments during the presentations of their products, we prepared for the worst. However, the app behaved as expected and the presentation was therefore successful.

After the demo, our co-founder Àlex Rodríguez directed a round table discussing the Barcelona entrepreneurial ecosystem. The guests were chosen to have one person representing each resource type: Gloria Molins (CEO @ <a href="http://www.trip4real.com/" title="Trip4Real" target="_blank">Trip4Real</a>), Daniel Sánchez (Founder @ <a href="http://www.nautacapital.com/" title="NautaCapital" target="_blank">NautaCapital</a>), Juan Pérez (Director at <a href="http://technovabarcelona.org" title="Innovator Park La Salle" target="_blank">Innovator Park La Salle</a>), Iolanda Triviño (CEO @ <a href="http://www.valkiriahubspace.com" title="Valkiria Hub Space" target="_blank">Valkiria Hub Space</a>) and Andrés Mansó (CEO @ <a href="http://www.incubio.com" title="Incubio" target="_blank">Incubio</a>). Each one shared in turns their opinion on the evolution of their sector in the last years, the current state and a prediction of where is the situation going. All of them had a common vision: the city had been nurturing its entrepreneurial tissue for some years, and is now ready for something big.

In the last years, Barcelona has been building up a very competitive entrepreneurial ecosystem. The number of new start-ups, acceleration and incubation programs, investors and coworking spaces, has grown very rapidly. All these actors are nowadays teaming up to create innovative, solid and disrupting projects.

###Next steps###

Our work here is not over. This is just the beginning of our collaboration with the Barcelona start-up scene.

If you want to know more about the map, such as the technical details or what did we take from this project, stay tuned. We are currently preparing a second part to this post.

In the meantime, we will keep making apps out of this world.

Love from Mars!
