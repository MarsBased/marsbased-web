*Captain's log, stardate {{page.date | martian_date}}*

Tuesday, October 9th will be a date to remember for all the Martians.

The last few months we have been swamped with work. Far from being a quiet and relaxed summer, the MarsBased flagship has been advancing at cruise speed. And to face the coming months, we hired a new developer.

During the summer we have been working non-stop to make MarsBased grow bigger, looking for larger projects that would allow an organic and sustainable growth of the company.

Turns out, one of the first contacts we ever made as MarsBased reached out to us some months ago to check our availability. Long story short, he had started the development with another offshore team and was dissatisfied with the experience, so he wanted us to take over the project. After analysing all the possible risks and the influence of the inherited code legacy, we agreed to work together.

However, the project requires a number of development hours per month that Xavi, our CTO, could himself not complete on his own. So we hired a new Martian called Javier PÃ©rez, who will be properly introduced in our next blog entry.

###The Abduction###

Because we're a remote working company, we do not have a physical office. We always meet our clients at their offices and seldom hold any get-togethers by now. So we went out for some coworking at one of the best venues in town: <a href="http://www.start2bee.com/" target="_blank" title="Start2bee coworking space">Start2bee</a>.

Javi is our first hire at MarsBased, so we made sure we gave him the best possible welcoming to the company.

He showed up with his new & shiny macbook pro and after having read the Martian Playbook, prepared for a day-long session of initiation.

The first part of the session consisted in a formal presentation of the company, our working methods and the company culture. Then, we proceeded to review the company history hitherto, project by project, to help understand MarsBased progression through the months and what have been working on up until now.

When introducing a new hire to your company, you need to make sure he does feel integrated as soon as possible, specially in small companies.

While terms like "family" or "friends" should be avoided on a daily basis (after all, this is a business relationship), experts tend to favour the usage of expressions such as "we're a team". Or else, no mentioning of this at all. Show, don't tell: act as a team and prove it. Practice what you preach.

Moreover, in small and ever-changing businesses such as startups, the figure of the leader is enforced, instead of the boss. Completely regardless of the obvious separating line between founders and non-founders, the importance of having little to no hierarchy at all can greatly improve morale within the troops.

To sum up, if you're really <i>a team</i>, you will prove it daily with facts.

###The Highlights###

Get-togethers, for working or leisure, are necessary in all companies, but even more so in remote working companies.

Imagine a team that never sees each other's faces save for videocalls. As hard as they might try, there's a great chance they will not bond as much as a normal company due to the lack of physical connection. Or, in our case, three of us live in Barcelona, while the fourth doesn't. Chances are, the isolated person might probably feel a little left out.

Get-togethers help bridging that gap. They create a sense of bonding that should be enforced regularly (every 2-6 months, for instance). They might also boost productivity for a day. Instead of everyone working separately like we normally do, for a day we all worked on the same stuff, discussing and joining forces, achieving better results through a different kind of focus.

Get-togethers like the one we had on Tuesday are also critical to help ease the introduction of a new team member. For as long as this is possible, we will try to maintain this tradition.

When welcoming a new hire to your company, he or she will want to meet the bosses & coworkers on the first day. From the company side, that shows appreciation and interest in the new employee. And if possible, it's more advisable to have a whole day together - working, in the coffee pauses, having lunch and sharing spaces. Not only will this help him/her gelling in with the rest of the crew, but they can all get to know one another sooner.

###Immediate future###

Our biggest challenge is to integrate Javi into the MarsBased culture & working methods as soon and natural as possible.

His challenge is to help us achieve the goals we've set, that we couldn't achieve without him, while bringing a whole lot of expertise in Javascript to our tech stack.

And for that, he (also) got a corporate coffee mug.

Welcome aboard, Javi.

PS: Xavi and Javi will be pair-programming during the next weeks at Start2bee a couple of days a week. Drop by to say hello, if you're around!
