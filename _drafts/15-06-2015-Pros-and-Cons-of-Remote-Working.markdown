###Breaking the myth: Remote teams never meet###

One of the most popular questions we get from friends, clients & colleagues is "how do you coordinate without ever meeting?". Well, for a start, we <i>do</i> meet. Most remote companies meet every now and then for the boarding of new hires, for company retreats or just because they decided to do it to strengthen the bonding among the team members.

We like to meet one day a week at our coworking space <a href="http://www.start2bee.com" title="Start2Bee" target="_blank">Start2bee</a> in the northern part of Barcelona. One day a week is usually enough to interact with the rest of the people and break the daily routine. Usually, that day is mostly used for planning, reporting and working on issues that require closer contact.

Additionally, once a month we celebrate the Martian Day. The Martian Day is a day we take off from client work, which is used to review or improve parts of the company, teach each other new technologies or work on side projects.
