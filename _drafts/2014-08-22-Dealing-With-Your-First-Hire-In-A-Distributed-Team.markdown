When we created MarsBased, we decided to be a social, outgoing and media-friendly company. We also wanted to help the community, to pay back what the community had helped us in the beginning.

In the early stages of a company, this is however something hard to achieve. The first priorities should be creating the company, establishing an organized accounting culture and sales, and developing your product.

###Dealing with your first hire###

We're talking about our first employee. So we read a lot of literature on how to deal with such situation, and here's the highlights of what we've learnt:

When introducing a new hire to your company, you need to make sure he does feel integrated as soon as possible, specially in small companies. And even more so, if he/she is your very first hire.

Firstly, terms like "family" or "friends" should be avoided on a daily basis. After all, this is a business relationship. Experts tend to favour the usage of expressions such as "we're a team", instead. Or else, no mentioning of this at all.

Show, don't tell: act as a team and prove it. Practice what you preach.

Moreover, in small and ever-changing businesses such as startups, the figure of the leader is enforced, instead of the classical boss. An almost-flat hierarchy helps easing this process.

Secondly, get-togethers, for work or leisure, are necessary in all companies, but even more so in remote working companies.

Imagine a team that never sees each other's faces save for videocalls. As hard as they might try, there's a great chance they will not bond as much as a normal company due to the lack of physical connection.

In distributed teams, not everybody lives in the same city. In some cases, you might even have an employee in the other side of the globe, that might probably feel a little left out if not dealt with properly.

Get-togethers help bridging that gap. They create a sense of bonding that should be enforced regularly.

They will also boost productivity for a day. Instead of everyone working separately like we normally do, for a day we all worked on the same issues, discussing and joining forces, achieving better results through a different kind of focus.

Lastly, get-togethers of the new hire's first day at the company are also critical to help ease the introduction to the rest of the crew.

When welcoming a new hire to your company, he or she will want to meet the bosses & coworkers on the first day. From the company side, that shows appreciation and interest in the new employee. And if possible, it's more advisable to have a whole day together in different situations - working, in the coffee breaks, having lunch and sharing spaces. Not only this will help him/her gelling in with the rest of the crew, but they can all get to know one another in a more natural way.
