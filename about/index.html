    <p>We are a Ruby on Rails specialized development shop created by three entrepreneurs who love building new products. Lovingly based in Barcelona, we like to work remotely from Silicon Valley, Barcelona or wherever we are.</p>
    <p>Our extensive background in big IT consulting firms such as Deloitte or ATOS gives us the know-how on how to get your business strategy right, perfectly aligned with our development methods.</p>
    <p>Think of us as an external CTO, to whom you can delegate all your technical projects, tasks or questions and we'll come up with the right answer.</p>
    <p>As a remote working company, communication is key to us. We'll invite you to our Basecamp & Trello accounts to be perfectly informed in real time of what's going on with the project.</p>
    <p>Our team of five is distributed around the globe, but has its headquarters in the northern part of the neighborhood of Gràcia, in Barcelona.</p>
