    <p>MarsBased is an offshore development start-up that has two main business lines: We create our own products and we can be hired to develop mobile or web apps that meet your needs.</p>
    <p>We mostly work with Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Elastic search and other similarly awesome technologies to develop our apps. Only using the best tools can we build our killer applications!</p>
    <p>Largely inspired by 37Signals' books "Rework", "Remote" and "Getting real", we're a lean start-up that relies on basic principles when developing: Simpler is better, working remotely and the usage of agile development methodologies to get things going.</p>
    <p>If you want us to develop for you, send us an e-mail with your idea and we will contact you ASAP.</p>
